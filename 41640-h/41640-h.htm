Translation.</h4>

<p class="letter_head">
Versailles, August 23d, 1782.</p>
<p class="letter_open">Sir,
</p>

<p>I have received the letter you did me the honor of
writing to me on the 9th instant, as well as the memorial
enclosed in it. I communicated the paper to the Marquis
de Castries, and I make no doubt, but that the Minister
will take into consideration its contents, as far as circumstances
will permit. We are desirous to adopt every
measure, that may tend to the prosperity of the commerce
established between France and the United States, and we
shall neglect nothing to accomplish this object to the universal
satisfaction of the two countries. Congress will
greatly facilitate our labor, if they will communicate their
ideas and wishes on this subject; and I make the request
with greater confidence, as I am convinced that that assembly
desires as much as we do to establish, on an advantageous
and solid basis, the commercial concerns between
France and America.</p>

<p>
I have the honor to be, &amp;c.</p>

<h3>THOMAS TOWNSHEND TO RICHARD OSWALD.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">
Whitehall, September 1st, 1782.</p>
<p class="letter_open">
Sir,
</p>

<p>I have received and laid before the King your letters
of the 17th, 18th, and 21st ultimo; and I am commanded
to signify to you his Majesty's approbation of your conduct
in communicating to the American Commissioners the
fourth article of your instructions; which could not but
convince them, that the negotiation for peace, and the cession
of independence to the Thirteen United Colonies,
were intended to be carried on and concluded with the
Commissioners in Europe.</p>

<p>Those gentlemen having expressed their satisfaction concerning
that article, it is hoped they will not entertain a
doubt of his Majesty's determination to exercise, in the
fullest extent, the powers with which the act of Parliament
has invested him, by granting to America, full, complete,
and unconditional independence, in the most explicit manner,
as an article of treaty.</p>

<h3>TO ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">
Passy, September 3d, 1782.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,
</p>

<p>I have just received yours, No. 13, dated the 23d of
June. The accounts of the general sentiments of our people,
respecting propositions from England, and the rejoicings
on the birth of the Dauphin, give pleasure here; and
it affords me much satisfaction to find the conduct of Congress
approved by all who hear or speak of it, and to see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
all the marks of a constantly growing regard for us, and
confidence in us, among those in whom such sentiments
are most to be desired.</p>

<p>I hope the affair of Captain Asgill was settled as it ought
to be, by the punishment of Lippincott. Applications have
been made here to obtain letters in favor of the young
gentleman. Enclosed I send you a copy of the answer
I gave to that made to me.</p>

<p>I had before acquainted M. Tousard, that his pension
would be paid in America, and there only, it being unreasonable
to expect that Congress should open a Pay Office
in every part of the world, where pensioners should choose
to reside. I shall communicate to him that part of your
letter.</p>

<p>You wish to know what allowance I make to my private
Secretary. My grandson, William T. Franklin, came
over with me, served me as a private Secretary during the
time of the Commissioners; and no Secretary to the Commission
arriving, though we had been made to expect one,
he did business for us all, and this without any allowance
for his services, though both Mr Lee and Mr Deane at
times mentioned it to me as a thing proper to be done, and
in justice due to him. When I became appointed sole
Minister here, and the whole business, which the Commissioners
had before divided with me, came into my hands,
I was obliged to exact more service from him, and he was
indeed, by being so long in the business, become capable
of doing more. At length, in the beginning of the year
1781 when he became of age, considering his constant
close attention to the duties required, and his having thereby
missed the opportunity of studying the law, for which
he had been intended, I determined to make him some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
compensation for the time past, and fix some compensation
for the time to come, till the pleasure of Congress respecting
him should be known. I accordingly settled an account
with him, allowing him from the beginning of December
1776 to the end of 1777, the sum of 3,400 livres, and
for the year 1778, the sum of 4,000 livres, for 1779, 4,800
livres, and for 1780, 6,000 livres. Since that time I have
allowed him at the rate of three hundred louis per annum,
being what I saw had been allowed by Congress to the Secretary
of Mr William Lee, who could not have had, I imagine,
a fourth part of the business to go through; since
my Secretary, besides the writing and copying the papers
relative to my common ministerial transactions, has had all
those occasioned by my acting in the various employments
of Judge of Admiralty, Consul, purchaser of goods for the
public, &amp;c. &amp;c. besides that of accepting the Congress
bills, a business that requires being always at home, bills
coming by post, from different ports and countries, and
often requiring immediate answers, whether good or not;
and to that end, it being necessary to examine by the
books, exactly kept of all preceding acceptances, in order
to detect double presentations, which happen very frequently.
The great number of these bills makes almost
sufficient business for one person, and the confinement they
occasion is such, that we cannot allow ourselves a day's
excursion into the country, and the want of exercise has
hurt our healths in several instances.</p>

<p>The Congress pay much larger salaries to some Secretaries,
who, I believe, deserve them; but not more than my
grandson does the comparatively small one I have allowed
to him, his fidelity, exactitude, and address in transacting
business, being really what one could wish in such an officer;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
and the genteel appearance a young gentleman in
his station obliges him to make, requiring at least such an
income. I do not mention the extraordinary business that
has been imposed upon us in this embassy, as a foundation
for demanding higher salaries than others. I never solicited
for a public office, either for myself, or any relation,
yet I never refused one, that I was capable of executing,
when public service was in question, and I never bargained
for salary, but contented myself with whatever my constituents
were pleased to allow me. The Congress will therefore
consider every article charged in my account, distinct
from the salary originally voted, not as what I presume to
insist upon, but as what I propose only for their consideration,
and they will allow what they think proper.</p>

<p>You desire an accurate estimate of those contingent expenses.
I enclose copies of two letters,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> which passed
between Mr Adams and me on the subject, and show the
articles of which they consist. Their amount in different
years may be found in my accounts, except the article of
house rent, which has never yet been settled; M. de Chaumont,
our landlord, having originally proposed to leave it
till the end of the war, and then to accept for it a piece of
American land from the Congress, such as they might
judge equivalent. If the Congress did intend all contingent
charges whatever to be included in the salary, and
do not think proper to pay on the whole so much, in that
case I would humbly suggest, that the saving may be most
conveniently made by a diminution of the salary, leaving
the contingencies to be charged; because they may necessarily
be very different in different years, and at different
courts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>I have been more diffuse on this subject, as your letter
gave occasion for it, and it is probably the last time I shall
mention it. Be pleased to present my dutiful respects to
Congress, assure them of my best services, and believe me
to be, with sincere esteem, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="signature">
B. FRANKLIN.

<p><em>P. S.</em> As you will probably lay this letter before Congress,
I take the liberty of joining to it an extract of my
letter to the President, of the 12th of March, 1781, and
of repeating my request therein contained, relative to my
grandson. I enclose, likewise, extracts of letters from
Messrs Jay and Laurens, which both show the regard
those gentlemen have for him, and their desire of his being
noticed by the Congress.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<h3>ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON TO B. FRANKLIN.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">Philadelphia, September 5th, 1782.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,
</p>

<p>Having written to you lately, I should not again trouble
you so soon, were it not necessary to remind you, that
your last letter is dated in March, since which there have
been frequent arrivals from France; and since which too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
we have reason to believe, the most interesting events
have taken place in Europe.</p>

<p>We learn from private letters and common fame, that
Mr Adams was received by the United Provinces in his
public character, on the 19th of April. We have yet no
account of this interesting event, nor of the measures he has
pursued to accomplish our other objects in Holland. Since
then Mr Laurens, it is said, has been liberated, has travelled
to Holland and to France, has entered upon the
execution of his trust, but has left us to gather events so
interesting to him and to us from private letters, and the
public prints. Mr Jay tells us on the 24th of May, that
he is about to set out for Paris, and that he presumes Dr
Franklin has assigned the reasons for this step. Doctor
Franklin has told us nothing.</p>

<p>As to Mr Dana, if it were not for the necessity of drawing
bills in his favor, we should hardly be acquainted with
his existence. It is commonly said, that republics are
better informed than monarchs of the state of their foreign
affairs, and that they insist upon a greater degree of
vigilance and punctuality in their Ministers. We, on the
contrary, seem to have adopted a new system. The ignorance,
in which we are kept, of every interesting event,
renders it impossible for the sovereign to instruct their servants,
and of course forms them into an independent privy
council for the direction of their affairs, without their advice
or concurrence. I can hardly express to you what I feel
on this occasion. I blush when I meet a member of Congress,
who inquires into what is passing in Europe. When
the General applies to me for advice on the same subject,
which must regulate his movements, I am compelled to
inform him, that we have no intelligence but what he has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
seen in the papers. The following is an extract of his
last letter to me. "But how does it happen, that all our
information of what is transacting in Europe should come
to hand through indirect channels, or from the enemy; or
does this question proceed from my unacquaintedness with
facts?"</p>

<p>But let me dismiss a subject, which gives me so much
pain, in the hope that we shall in future have no further
cause of complaint.</p>

<p>Since the evacuation of Savannah, the enemy have by
the general orders contained in the enclosed papers, announced
the proposed evacuation of Charleston. We are
in daily expectation of hearing, therefore, that tranquillity
is restored to the Southern States. Several circumstances
lead us to suppose, that they entertain thoughts of abandoning
New York sometime this fall. You <em>only</em> can inform
us, whether this step has been taken in consequence of
any expectations they entertain of a general peace; or
with a view to pursue the system, which the present administration
appears to have adopted, when they so loudly reprobate
the American war; and whether, by withdrawing
their troops from hence they only mean to collect their
force and direct it against our allies. This knowledge
would render such an alteration in our system necessary,
that it affords us new reasons for regretting our want of
information on these important points.</p>

<p>The Marquis de Vaudreuil has unfortunately lost the
Magnifique, sunk by running on a rock in the harbor of
Boston, where he is now, with the remainder of his fleet,
except three refitting at Portsmouth, consisting of twelve
sail of the line. This has enabled Congress to show their
attention to His Most Christian Majesty, and their wish to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
promote his interests as far as their circumstances will permit,
by presenting him the America, of seventyfour guns.
Enclosed are their resolves on that subject, and the answer
given by the Minister of France. The ship is in such a
state, that she may by diligence be refitted for sea in about
two months; and from the accounts I hear of her, she
will I believe prove a fine ship. The General is collecting
the army. The last division of the French troops
marched from here this morning. When collected, they
will, I presume, repair to their old post, at the White
Plains, and perhaps endeavor to accelerate the departure
of the enemy.</p>

<p>I am sorry you did not pursue your first design, and enlarge
in your letter upon the subjects, which you imagined
would be discussed in the negotiations for peace. It might
have changed our sentiments, and altered our views on
some points. Two things are of great moment to us, one
of which at least would meet with no difficulty, if France
and England understand their true interests; I mean the
West India trade, and the right to cut logwood and mahogany.
Without a free admission of all kinds of provisions
into the Islands, our agriculture will suffer extremely.
This will be severely felt at first, and when it remedies
itself, which it will do in time, it must be at the expense
of the nations that share our commerce. It will lessen the
consumption of foreign sugars, increase the supplies which
the poorer people among us draw from the maple, &amp;c. and
by reducing the price of provision, and rendering the cultivation
of lands less profitable, make proportionable increase
of our own manufactures, and lessen our dependence on
Europe. This will, I must confess, in some measure check
our population, and so far I regard it as an evil. The merchants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
and farmers, if precluded at a peace from the advantages,
which this commerce gave them while connected
with England, &mdash;&mdash;.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Then a variety of arguments on
this subject, arising as well from the general interests
of France, as from her political connexion with us, might
be urged to show the wisdom of adopting the same liberal
sentiments on this point, which has of late distinguished her
in so many others. But if she should not be able to overcome
her ancient prejudices, I believe they will be found
to have less influence on the British, whom you will press
earnestly on this head. Besides the general interest of the
kingdom, there is with them a powerful West India interest,
to plead in behalf of a free importation of provisions into their
Islands. If I mistake not, the present wishes of the nation,
as well as the professions of administration, lead to every
measure, which may wear away our present resentments,
and strengthen the connexion between us and them.</p>

<p>The logwood trade we have some claim to, from our
continued exercise of the right. Nor can England pretend
to exclude us from it, without invalidating her own title,
which stands upon the same ground. If Spain admits the
right in England, she gains nothing by excluding us, since
in proportion as she diminishes our commerce in that article,
she increases that of Great Britain. Other manufacturing
nations are interested in exciting a competition between
us at their markets.</p>

<p>When you write to me, be pleased to be very particular
in your relation of every step, which leads to a negotiation.
Everything of this kind must be interesting.</p>

<p>
I have the honor to be, Sir,</p>

<h3>DAVID HARTLEY TO B. FRANKLIN.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">
Bath, October 4th, 1782.</p>
<p class="letter_open">
My Dear Friend,
</p>

<p>I only write one line to you, to let you know that I am
not forgetful of you, or of our common concerns. I have
not heard anything from the Ministry yet; I believe it is a
kind of vacation with them, before the meeting of Parliament.
I have told you of a proposition, which I have had
some thoughts to make as a kind of copartnership in commerce.
I send you a purposed temporary convention,
which I have drawn up. You are to consider it only as
one I recommend. The words underlined are grafted
upon the proposition of my Memorial, dated May 19th,
1778. You will see the principle, which I have in my
thoughts to extend for the purpose of restoring our ancient
copartnership generally.</p>

<p>I cannot tell you what event things may take, but my
thoughts are always employed in endeavoring to arrange
that system upon which the <em>China Vase</em>, lately shattered,
may be cemented together, upon principles of compact and
connexion, instead of dependence.</p>

<p>I have met with a sentiment in this country which gives
some alarm, viz. lest the unity of government in America
should be uncertain, and the States reject the authority of
Congress. Some passages in General Washington's letter
have given weight to these doubts. I do not hear of any
tendency to this opinion; <em>that the American States will
break to pieces, and then we may still conquer them</em>. I
believe all that folly is extinguished. But many serious
and well disposed persons are alarmed, lest <em>this should be
the ill-fated moment for relaxing the powers of the union,</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
<em>and annihilating the cement of confederation</em>, (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vide</i> Washington's
letter,) and that Great Britain should thereby lose
her best and wisest hope of being reconnected with the
American States <em>unitedly</em>. I should for one think it the
greatest misfortune. Pray give me some opinion upon
this.</p>

<p>You see there is likewise another turn, which may be
given to this sentiment by intemperate and disappointed
people, who may indulge a passionate revenge for their
own disappointments, by endeavoring to excite general
distrust, discord, and disunion. I wish to be prepared
and guarded at all points.</p>

<p>I beg my best compliments to your colleagues; be so
good as to show this letter to them. I beg particularly my
condolence (and I hope congratulation) to Mr Adams; I
hear that he has been very dangerously ill, but that he is
again recovered. I hope the latter part is true, and that
we shall all survive to set our hands to some future compacts
of common interest, and common affection, between
our two countries.</p>

Your ever affectionate,</p>

<h3>TO ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">
Passy, October 14th, 1782.</p>

<p class="letter_open">
Sir,
</p>

<p>I have but just received information of this opportunity,
and have only time allowed to write a few lines.</p>

<p>In my last of the 26th past, I mentioned that the negotiation
for peace had been obstructed, by the want of due form
in the English commissions appointing their plenipotentiaries.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
In that for treating with us, the mentioning our States
by their public name had been avoided, which we objected
to; another is come, of which I send a copy enclosed. We
have now made several preliminary propositions, which the
English Minister, Mr Oswald, has approved, and sent to
his Court. He thinks they will be approved there, but I
have some doubts. In a few days, however, the answer
expected will determine. By the first of these articles, the
King of Great Britain renounces for himself and successors,
all claim and pretension to dominion or territory within
the Thirteen United States; and the boundaries are described
as in our instructions, except that the line between
Nova Scotia and New England is to be settled by Commissioners
after the peace. By another article, the fishery in
the American seas is to be freely exercised by the Americans,
wherever they might formerly exercise it while
united with Great Britain. By another, the citizens and
subjects of each nation are to enjoy the same protection
and privileges, in each others' ports and countries, respecting
commerce, duties, &amp;c. that are enjoyed by native subjects.
The articles are drawn up very fully by Mr Jay,
who I suppose sends you a copy; if not, it will go by the
next opportunity. If these articles are agreed to, I apprehend
little difficulty in the rest. Something has been mentioned
about the refugees and English debts, but not insisted
on, as we declared at once, that whatever confiscations
had been made in America, being in virtue of the laws of
particular States, the Congress had no authority to repeal
those laws, and therefore could give us none to stipulate for
such repeal.</p>

<p>I have been honored with the receipt of your letters, Nos
14 and 15. I have also received two letters from Mr<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
Lewis R. Morris, both dated the 6th of July, and one dated
the 10th of August, enclosing bills for</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">68,290 livres,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">71,380</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4.5em;">9,756</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3.5em;">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</span><br />
In all 149,426 livres,<br />
</p>

<p>being intended for the payment of Ministers' salaries for the
two first quarters of this year. But as these bills came so
late, that all those salaries were already paid, I shall make
no use of the bills, but lay them by till further orders; and
the salaries of different Ministers not having all the same
times of falling due, as they had different commencements,
I purpose to get all their accounts settled and reduced to
the same period, and send you the state of them, that you
may be clear in future orders. I see in one of the estimates
sent me, that a quarter's salary of a Minister is
reckoned at 14,513 livres, in the other it is reckoned
16,667 livres, and the bill for 9,756<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> livres is mentioned
as intended to pay a balance due on the remittance of the
68,290 livres. Being unacquainted with the state of your
exchange, I do not well comprehend this, and therefore
leave the whole for the present, as I have said above.
Permit me only to hint for your consideration, whether it
may not be well hereafter to omit mention of sterling, in
our appointments, since we have severed from the country
to which that denomination of money is peculiar; and also
to order the payment of your Ministers in such a manner,
that they may know exactly what they are to receive, and
not be subject to the fluctuations of exchange. If it is that,
which occasions the difference between 14,583 for the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
quarter, and the 16,667 for the second, it is considerable.
I think we have no right to any advantage by the exchange,
nor should we be liable to any loss from it. Hitherto we
have taken 15,000 for a quarter, (subject however to the
allowance or disallowance of Congress) which is lower than
the medium between those two extremes.</p>

<p>The different accounts given of Lord Shelburne's character,
with respect to sincerity, induced the Ministry here
to send over M. de Rayneval, Secretary to the Council, to
converse with him, and endeavor to form by that means a
more perfect judgment of what was to be expected from
the negotiations. He was five or six days in England,
saw all the Ministers, and returned quite satisfied, that they
are sincerely desirous of peace, so that the negotiations
now go on with some prospect of success. But the Court
and people of England are very changeable. A little turn
of fortune in their favor sometimes turns their heads; and
I shall not think a speedy peace to be depended on, till I
see the treaties signed. I am obliged to finish.</p>

<p class="letter_head">
Philadelphia, November 9th, 1782.</p>

<p class="letter_open">
Dear Sir,
</p>

<p>Mr Stewart, informing me that he shall set out tomorrow
for Paris, will be the bearer of this, and duplicates
of my last letters. The want of time will prevent
my sending Mr Jay duplicates of the resolutions formerly
enclosed to him, which will be the more unnecessary as
you will communicate those you receive with this, if my
former letters containing them, have not reached him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>We are much flattered by the proposals of Sweden,
and feel all the force of its Minister's observations; every
new acknowledgment lays the foundation of others, and
familiarizes Great Britain with the idea of acknowledging
us as sovereign and independent. I feel some pleasure,
too, in thinking that you are to be the instrument of
procuring us new connexions, and beg leave to remind
you of another which calls upon your attention, though
it seems to have been forgotten in the hurry of business.
I mean that with the States of Barbary. The good dispositions
of the Court of France towards us, and the
enlarged policy by which their measures are actuated,
together with the coolness that at present subsists between
the Emperor of Morocco and Great Britain, (if we are
well informed) seem to point out this as the favorable
moment for making ourselves known to him. As Mr
Jay is now with you, I wish you would consult upon
the means of bringing this about, so that we may not
be shut out of the Mediterranean in future.</p>

<p>I know you will start a very obvious objection. But
as this can only be removed by your influence where you
now are, we rely upon you for the means as well as for
the manner of treating. I have not thought it necessary
to say anything to Congress on this subject, nor shall I,
till you give me hopes that something may be done in it.</p>

<p>The only political object of a general nature, that has
been touched upon in Congress since my last, is the exchange
of prisoners, which seems at present to be as far
as ever from being effected. The propositions on the side
of the enemy were to exchange seamen for soldiers, they
having no soldiers in their hands; that the soldiers so
exchanged should not serve for one year against the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
United States; that the sailors might go into immediate
service; that the remainder of the soldiers in our hands
should be given up at a stipulated price.</p>

<p>Congress rejected this proposal as unequal; as letting
loose a force, which might be employed against our allies
in the West Indies; as making no provision for the payment
of the large balance due to us for the maintenance of
prisoners. They further required, that General Carleton
should explicitly declare, that the powers he gives to his
Commissioners for negotiating an exchange are derived
from the King of Great Britain, so that any engagement
for the payment of the debt they have incurred may be
considered as binding upon the nation. With respect to
Mr Laurens, they have come to no decided opinion. The
Committee to whom it was referred, reporting that,</p>

<p>"With respect to the information contained in the extract
of Sir Guy Carleton's and Admiral Digby's letter
of the 2d of August, '<em>that after Mr Laurens was discharged,
he declared that he considered Lord Cornwallis
as freed from his parole</em>,' your Committee conceive it
sufficient to observe, that no intimation having been received
of such a fact, except, from the said extract, and
Congress having given no directions to that purpose, the
consideration thereof would in their opinion be premature,
and ought therefore to be deferred." Since which, though
letters have been received from Mr Laurens, they have
come to no resolution, unless their direction to him to proceed
in the business of his mission may be considered as
such.</p>

<p>General Carleton has sent out the trial of Lippincott,
which admits the murder of Huddy, but justifies Lippincott
under an <em>irregular</em> order of the Board of Refugees. So<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
paltry a palliation of so black a crime would not have been
admitted, and Captain Asgill would certainly have paid the
forfeit for the injustice of his countrymen, had not the interposition
of their Majesties prevented. The letter from
the Count de Vergennes is made the groundwork of the
resolution passed on that subject. I shall transmit you the
resolve.</p>

<p>I suppose I need not tell you, that the enemy contrived
to get off the Eagle and to carry her, to New York. You
will find, in the enclosed papers, a very polite letter from
Captain Elphingston; it is easier to be so in word than in
deed among the British. Digby has refused to permit
him to comply with his engagement, at least so far as his
share of the prize is concerned, and insists upon dividing
the baggage of the officers, and sharing the eighth pair of
breeches, &amp;c.</p>

<p>On the 4th instant, Mr Boudinot was elected President
in the room of Mr Hanson, whose term of service had expired.
Mr Lewis Morris will enclose bills purchased here
at six shillings and three pence, currency, for five livres,
to the amount of your last quarter's salary, ending the first

<h3>ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON TO B. FRANKLIN.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">
Philadelphia, November 21st, 1782.</p>
<p class="letter_open">
Sir,
</p>

<p>Congress a few days since, passed the enclosed resolution,
No. 1, by which they have added Mr Jefferson to
the commission for concluding a peace. The established
character of this gentleman gives me reason to hope, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
his appointment will be very acceptable to you, and the
other gentlemen in the commission. I have not yet learned
whether he will take the task upon him, but I have reason
to believe he will, the death of his wife having lessened, in
the opinion of his friends, the reluctance which he has
hitherto manifested to going abroad. I think it would be
proper to make a formal annunciation of this resolution to
the Court of France. You will naturally give such a representation
of Mr Jefferson's character, as will secure to him
there that esteem and confidence which he justly merits.
The resolution, No. 2, needs no comment; or if it does,
Mr Morris will prove the able commentator. I resign the
task to him.</p>

<p>For what end are the show of negotiations kept up by
England, when peace upon the only terms she can possibly
expect to obtain it is far from her heart? Her Ministers,
like some Ministers of the Gospel, who are unwilling to
quit the pulpit when they have tired out their hearers, expect
to keep the people together by calling out at every
period, "now to conclude," while they continue the same
dull tale for want of skill to wind it up.</p>

<p>By accounts from Jamaica, we learn that the British
have recovered most of their settlements on the Bay.
Some attention will, I hope, be paid in the treaty of peace
to secure to us the share we formerly had in the logwood
trade; it was a valuable remittance to us, and the low
price at which we were enabled to sell renders it important
to other nations, that we should not be excluded from
furnishing it as usual. You will find by the enclosed
paper, that Mr Burgess, an English merchant, was not
permitted to settle at Boston and obtain the rights of citizenship,
upon principles which must be alarming to England.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
It shows at the same time the respect that is paid to
the resolutions of Congress, notwithstanding all that has
been said and written to prove the contrary.</p>

I am, Sir, &amp;c.</p>

<p><em>P. S.</em> I forgot to mention, that I am solicited by Mr
Barlow to transmit to you proposals for printing a work of
his, which you will find described in the enclosed proposals,
as they are accompanied with a specimen of his
poetry, which is as much as I have seen of it. You will
judge yourself how far it deserves the patronage he wishes
you to give it.</p>

<h3>TO RICHARD OSWALD.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">
Passy, November 26th, 1782.</p>
<p class="letter_open">
Sir,
</p>

<p>You may well remember, that in the beginning of our
conferences, before the other Commissioners arrived, on
your mentioning to me a retribution for the royalists, whose
estates had been confiscated, I acquainted you that nothing
of that kind could be stipulated by us, the confiscation
being made by virtue of laws of particular States, which
the Congress had no power to contravene or dispense
with, and therefore could give us no such authority in our
commission. And I gave it as my opinion and advice,
honestly and cordially, that if a reconciliation was intended,
no mention should be made in our negotiations of those
people; for they having done infinite mischief to our properties,
by wantonly burning and destroying farm-houses,
villages, and towns, if compensation for their losses were
insisted on, we should certainly exhibit again such an account<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
of all the ravages they had committed, which would
necessarily recall to view scenes of barbarity that must inflame,
instead of conciliating, and tend to perpetuate an
enmity that we all profess a desire of extinguishing. Understanding,
however, from you, that this was a point your
Ministry had at heart, I wrote concerning it to Congress,
and I have lately received the following resolution, viz.</p>

<blockquote><p class="center">"<em>By the United States, in Congress assembled.</em>"</p>

<p class="letter_head">
September 10th, 1782.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Resolved</span>, That the Secretary for Foreign Affairs be,
and he is hereby directed to obtain, as speedily as possible,
authentic returns of the slaves and other property,
which have been carried off or destroyed in the course of
the war by the enemy, and to transmit the same to the
Ministers Plenipotentiary for negotiating peace.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Resolved</span>, That, in the meantime, the Secretary for
Foreign Affairs inform the said Ministers, that many thousands
of slaves, and other property, to a very great
amount, have been carried off, or destroyed by the
enemy; and that in the opinion of Congress, the great
loss of property, which the citizens of the United States
have sustained by the enemy, will be considered by the several
States as an insuperable bar to their making restitution
or indemnification to the former owner of property,
which has been, or may be forfeited to, or confiscated by
any of the States."</p></blockquote>

<p>In consequence of these resolutions and circular letters
of the Secretary, the Assembly of Pennsylvania, then sitting,
passed the following act, viz.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="center"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>"<em>State of Pennsylvania, in General Assembly.</em>"</p>

<p>
Wednesday, September 18th, 1782.<br />
</p>

<p>"The bill, entitled 'An Act for procuring an estimate of
the damages sustained by the inhabitants of Pennsylvania,
from the troops and adherents of the King of Great Britain
during the present war,' was read a second time.</p>

<p>"Ordered to be transcribed, and printed for public consideration.</p>

<p>
Extract from the minutes.</p>

<p class="signature">
<span class="smcap">Peter Z. Lloyd.</span><br />
<br />
<em>Clerk of the General Assembly.</em>"<br />
</p>

<p>"Whereas great damages, of the most wanton nature,
have been committed by the armies of the King of Great
Britain, or their adherents within the territory of the United
States of North America, unwarranted by the practice
of civilized nations, and only to be accounted for from the
vindictive spirit of the said King and his officers; and
whereas an accurate account and estimate of such damages,
more especially the waste and destruction of property,
may be very useful to the people of the United States of
America, in forming a future treaty of peace, and, in the
meantime, may serve to exhibit in a true light to the
nations of Europe the conduct of the said King, his Ministers,
officers, and adherents; to the end, therefore, that
proper measures be taken to ascertain the damages aforesaid,
which have been done to the citizens and inhabitants
of Pennsylvania, in the course of the present war within
this State; Be it enacted by the House of Representatives
of the freemen of the commonwealth of Pennsylvania,
in General Assembly met, and by the authority of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
same, that in every county of this State, which has been
invaded by the armies, soldiers, or adherents of the King
of Great Britain, the Commissioners of every such county
shall immediately meet together, each within their county,
and issue directions to the assessors of the respective
townships, districts, and places within such county, to call
upon the inhabitants of every township and place, to furnish
accounts and estimates of the damages, waste, spoil,
and destruction, which have been done and committed as
aforesaid, upon the property, real or personal, within the
same township or place, since the first day of &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  which
was in the year of our Lord 177&nbsp; , and the same accounts
and estimates to be transmitted to the Commissioners
without delay. And if any person or persons shall refuse
or neglect to make out such accounts and estimates, the
said assessors of the township or place shall, from their
own knowledge, and by any other reasonable and lawful
method, take and render such an account and estimate of
all damage done or committed, as aforesaid; Provided
always, that all such accounts and estimates to be made
out and transmitted as aforesaid, shall contain a narrative
of the time and circumstances; and if in the power of the
person aggrieved, the names of the General, or other officers
or adherents of the enemy by whom the damage in
any case was done, or under whose orders the army, detachment,
party, or persons, committing the same, acted at
that time, and also the name and condition of the person
or persons, whose property was so damaged or destroyed,
and that all such accounts and estimates be made in current
money, upon oath or affirmation of the sufferer, or
of others having knowledge concerning the same; and that
in every case it be set forth, whether the party injured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
hath received any satisfaction for his loss, and by whom
the same was given.</p>

<p>"And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid,
that the said Commissioners, having obtained the said
accounts and estimates from the assessor of the several
townships and places, shall proceed to inspect and register
the same in a book, to be provided for that purpose, distinguishing
the districts and townships, and entering those
of each place together; and if any account and estimate
be imperfect, or not sufficiently verified and established,
the said Commissioners shall have power, and they, or any
two of them, are hereby authorised to summon and compel
any person, whose evidence they shall think necessary, to
appear before them at a day and place appointed, to be
summoned upon oath or affirmation, concerning any damage
or injury as aforesaid; and the said Commissioners
shall, upon the call and demand of the President, or Vice
President of the Supreme Executive Council, deliver, or
send to the Secretary of the said council, all or any of the
original accounts and estimates aforesaid, and shall also deliver,
or send to the said Secretary, copies of the book
aforesaid, or any part or parts thereof, upon reasonable
notice. And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid,
that all losses of negro or mulatto slaves and servants,
who have been deluded and carried away by the enemies
of the United States, and who have not been recovered or
recompensed, shall be comprehended within the accounts
and estimates aforesaid; and that the Commissioners and
assessors of any county, which had not been invaded as
aforesaid, shall nevertheless inquire after, and procure accounts
and estimates of any damages suffered by the loss
of such servants and slaves, as is herein before directed as
to other property.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>"And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid,
that the charges and expenses of executing this act, as to
the pay of the said Commissioners and assessors, shall be
as in other cases; and that witnesses shall be rewarded
for their loss of time and trouble, as witnesses summoned
to appear in the courts of quarter sessions of the peace;
and the said charges and expenses shall be defrayed by
the commonwealth; but paid, in the first instance, out of
the hands of the Treasurer of the County, for county
rates, and levies upon orders drawn by the Commissioners
of the proper county."</p></blockquote>

<p>We have not yet had time to hear what has been done
by the other assemblies; but I have no doubt that similar
acts will be made use of by all of them, and that the mass
of evidence produced by the execution of those acts, not
only of the enormities committed by those people, under
the direction of the British Generals, but of those committed
by the British troops themselves, will form a record
that must render the British name odious in America to
the latest generations. In that authentic record will be
found the burning of the fine towns of Charlestown, near
Boston; of Falmouth, just before winter, when the sick,
the aged, the women and children, were driven to seek
shelter where they could hardly find it; of Norfolk, in the
midst of winter; of New London, of Fairfield, of Esopus,
&amp;c. besides near a hundred and fifty miles of well settled
country laid waste; every house and barn burnt, and many
hundreds of farmers, with their wives and children, butchered
and scalped.</p>

<p>The present British Ministers, when they reflect a little,
will certainly be too equitable to suppose, that their nation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
has a right to make an unjust war, (which they have always
allowed this against us to be,) and do all sorts of unnecessary
mischief, unjustifiable by the practice of any individual
people, which those they make war with are to suffer
without claiming any satisfaction; but that if Britons, or
their adherents, are in return deprived of any property, it
is to be restored to them, or they are to be indemnified.
The British troops can never excuse their barbarities.
They were unprovoked. The loyalists may say in excuse
of theirs, that they were exasperated by the loss of their
estates, and it was revenge. They have then had their
revenge. <em>Is it right they should have both?</em></p>

<p>Some of those people may have merit in their regard
for Britain, and who espoused her cause from affection;
these it may become you to reward. But there are many
of them who were waverers, and were only determined to
engage in it by some occasional circumstance or appearances;
these have not much of either merit or demerit;
and there are others, who have abundance of demerit respecting
your country, having by their falsehoods and misrepresentations
brought on and encouraged the continuance
of the war; these, instead of being recompensed, should
be punished.</p>

<p>It is usual among Christian people at war to profess
always a desire of peace; but if the Ministers of one of
the parties choose to insist particularly on a certain article,
which they have known the others are not and cannot be
empowered to agree to, what credit can they expect should
be given to such professions?</p>

<p>Your Ministers require that we should receive again
into our bosom those who have been our bitterest enemies,
and restore their properties who have destroyed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
ours, and this, while the wounds they have given us are
still bleeding! It is many years since your nation expelled
the Stuarts and their adherents, and confiscated their
estates. Much of your resentment against them may by
this time be abated; yet, if we should propose it, and
insist on it as an article of our treaty with you, that that
family should be recalled and the forfeited estates of its
friends restored, would you think us serious in our progressions
of earnestly desiring peace?</p>

<p>I must repeat my opinion, that it is best for you to drop
all mention of the refugees. We have proposed, indeed,
nothing but what we think best for you as well as
ourselves. But if you will have them mentioned, let it be in an
article, in which you may provide, that they shall exhibit accounts
of their losses to the Commissioners, hereafter to be
appointed, who should examine the same, together with
the accounts now preparing in America of the damages
done by them, and state the account, and that if a balance
appears in their favor, it shall be paid by us to you, and
by you divided among them as you shall think proper.
And if the balance is found due to us, it shall be paid by
you.</p>

<p>Give me leave, however, to advise you to prevent the
necessity of so dreadful a discussion by dropping the
article, that we may write to America and stop the inquiry.</p>

<p>
I have the honor to be, &amp;c.</p>

<p>An opportunity offering from this port to write directly
to you, I do not choose to hazard anything by the post,
which carries this to Boston, particularly as I did not hear

The sheriff stands in the gap.</p>

<p>The Swiss officer mentioned in yours, I have sent to

<h3>TO ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">
Passy, December 5th, 1782.</p>

<p class="letter_open">
Sir,
</p>

<p>I am honored by your several letters, Nos 16, 17, 18
and 19, dated September 5th, 13th, 15th, and 18th. I
believe that the complaints you make in them of my not
writing, may ere now have appeared less necessary, as
many of my letters written before those complaints must
have since come to hand. I will nevertheless mention some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
of the difficulties your Ministers meet with, in keeping up a
regular and punctual correspondence. We are far from
the seaports, and not well informed, and often misinformed
about the sailing of vessels. Frequently we are told they
are to sail in a week or two, and often they lie in the ports
for months after, with our letters on board, either waiting
for convoy, or for other reasons. The post office here is
an unsafe conveyance; many of the letters we received by
it have evidently been opened, and doubtless the same
happens to those we send; and at this time particularly,
there is so violent a curiosity in all kinds of people to know
something relating to the negotiations, and whether peace
may be expected, or a continuance of the war, that there
are few private hands or travellers, that we can trust
with carrying our despatches to the seacoast; and I imagine
that they may sometimes be opened and destroyed
because they cannot be well sealed. Again, the observation
you make, that the Congress Ministers in Europe
seem to form themselves into a privy council, transacting
affairs without the privity or concurrence of the sovereign,
may be in some respects just; but it should be considered,
that if they do not write as frequently as other Ministers
here do to their respective Courts, or if when they write,
their letters are not regularly received, the greater distance
of the seat of war, and the extreme irregularity of conveyances
may be the causes, and not a desire of acting without
the knowledge or orders of their constituents. There
is no European Court, to which an express cannot be sent
from Paris in ten or fifteen days, and from most of them
answers may be obtained in that time. There is, I imagine,
no Minister who would not think it safer to act by
orders than from his own discretion; and yet, unless you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
leave more to the discretion of your Ministers in Europe
than Courts usually do, your affairs may sometimes suffer
extremely from the distance which, in the time of war
especially, may make it five or six months before the
answer to a letter shall be received. I suppose the Minister
from this Court will acquaint Congress with the
King's sentiments, respecting their very handsome present
of a ship of the line. People in general here are much
pleased with it.</p>

<p>I communicated, together with my memoir demanding a
supply of money, copies of every paragraph in your late
letters, which express so strongly the necessity of it. I
have been constant in my solicitations both directly, and
through the Marquis de Lafayette, who has employed himself
diligently and warmly in the business. The negotiations
for peace are, I imagine, one cause of the great delay and
indecision on this occasion beyond what has been usual, as
the quantum may be different if those negotiations do or
do not succeed. We have not yet learnt what we may
expect. We have been told that we shall be aided, but it
cannot be to the extent demanded; six millions have been
mentioned, but not as a sum fixed. The Minister tells
me still, that he is working upon the subject, but cannot
yet give a determinative answer. I know his good will to
do the best for us that is possible.</p>

<p>It is in vain for me to repeat again what I have so often
written, and what I find taken so little notice of, that there
are bounds to everything, and that the faculties of this
nation are limited like those of all other nations. Some of
you seem to have established as maxims the suppositions,
that France has money enough for all her occasions,
and all ours besides; and that if she does not supply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
us, it is owing to her want of will, or to my negligence.
As to the first, I am sure it is not true, and to the
second, I can only say I should rejoice as much as any
man in being able to obtain more; and I shall also rejoice
in the greater success of those who may take my
place. You desire to be very particularly acquainted with
"every step which tends to negotiation." I am, therefore,
encouraged to send you the first part of the journal, which
accidents, and a long severe illness interrupted; but which,
from notes I have by me, may be continued if thought
proper. In its present state, it is hardly fit for the inspection
of Congress, certainly not for public view. I confide
it therefore to your prudence.</p>

<p>The arrival of Mr Jay, Mr Adams, and Mr Laurens,
has relieved me from much anxiety, which must have continued,
if I had been left to finish the treaty alone; and
it has given me the more satisfaction, as I am sure the
business has profited by their assistance.</p>

<p>Much of the summer has been taken up in objecting
against the powers given by Great Britain, and in removing
those objections. The not using any expressions, that might
imply an acknowledgment of our independence, seemed at
first industriously to be avowed. But our refusing otherwise
to treat, at length induced them to get over that
difficulty, and then we came to the point of making propositions.
Those made by Mr Jay and me before the
arrival of the other gentlemen, you will find in the paper
A, which was sent by the British Plenipotentiary to London
for the King's consideration. After some weeks, an
under secretary, Mr Strachey, arrived, with whom we had
much contestation about the boundaries and other articles
which he proposed and we settled; some of which he carried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
to London, and returned with the propositions, some
adopted, others omitted or altered, and new ones added,
which you will see in paper B. We spent many days in
disputing, and at length agreed on and signed the preliminaries,
which you will see by this conveyance. The British
Minister struggled hard for two points, that the favors
granted to the royalists should be extended, and all our
fishery contracted. We silenced them on the first, by
threatening to produce an account of the mischief done by
those people, and as to the second, when they told us they
could not possibly agree to it as we requested it, and must
refer it to the Ministry in London, we produced a new
article to be referred at the same time, with a note of facts
in support of it, which you have, C.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Apparently, it
seemed, that to avoid the discussion of this, they suddenly
changed their minds, dropped the design of recurring to
London, and agreed to allow the fishery as demanded.</p>

<p>You will find in the preliminaries some inaccurate
and ambiguous expressions, that want explanation, and
which may be explained in the definitive treaty, and as the
British Ministry excluded our proposition relating to commerce,
and the American prohibition of that with England
may not be understood to cease merely by our concluding
a treaty of peace, perhaps we may then, if the Congress
shall think fit to direct it, obtain some compensation for the
injuries done us as a condition of our opening again the
trade. Every one of the present British Ministry has,
while in the Ministry, declared the war against us as unjust,
and nothing is clearer in reason, than that those who
injure others by an unjust war, should make full reparation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
They have stipulated too, in these preliminaries, that in
evacuating our towns, they shall carry off no plunder,
which is a kind of acknowledgment that they ought not to
have done it before.</p>

<p>The reason given us for dropping the article relating
to commerce, was, that some statutes were in the
way, which must be repealed before a treaty of that kind
could be well formed, and that this was a matter to be
considered in Parliament.</p>

<p>They wanted to bring their boundary down to the
Ohio, and to settle their loyalists in the Illinois country.
We did not choose such neighbors.</p>

<p>We communicated all the articles, as soon as they
were signed, to Count de Vergennes, (except the separate
one) who thinks we have managed well, and told
me that we had settled what was most apprehended as
a difficulty in the work of a general peace, by obtaining
the declaration of our independency.</p>

<p><em>December 14th.</em> I have this day learnt, that the principal
preliminaries between France and England are agreed
on, to wit.</p>

<p>1st. France is to enjoy the right of fishing and drying
on all the west coast of Newfoundland, down to Cape
Ray. Miquelon and St Pierre to be restored, and may
be fortified.</p>

<p>2d. Senegal remains to France, and Goree to be restored.
The Gambia entirely to England.</p>

<p>3d. All the places taken from France in the East Indies
to be restored, with a certain quantity of territory round
them.</p>

<p>4th. In the West Indies, Grenada and the Grenadines,
St Christophers, Nevis and Montserat, to be restored to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
England. St Lucia to France. Dominique to remain
with France, and St Vincents to be neutralized.</p>

<p>5th. No Commissioner at Dunkirk.</p>

<p>The points not yet quite settled are the territory round
the places in the Indies, and neutralization of St Vincents.
Apparently these will not create much difficulty.</p>

<p>Holland has yet hardly done anything in her negotiation.</p>

<p>Spain offers for Gibraltar to restore West Florida and
the Bahamas. An addition is talked of the island of Guadaloupe,
which France will cede to Spain in exchange for
the other half of Hispaniola, and Spain to England, but
England, it is said, chose rather Porto Rico. Nothing yet
concluded.</p>

<p>As soon as I received the commission and instructions
for treating with Sweden, I waited on the Ambassador
here, who told me he daily expected a courier on that subject.
Yesterday he wrote a note to acquaint me, that he
would call on me today, having something to communicate
to me. Being obliged to go to Paris, I waited on him,
when he showed me the full powers he had just received,
and I showed him mine. We agreed to meet on Wednesday
next, exchange copies, and proceed to business. His
commission has some polite expressions in it, to wit; "that
his Majesty thought it for the good of his subjects to enter
into a treaty of amity and commerce with the United States
of America, who had established their independence so
justly merited by their courage and constancy;" or to that
effect. I imagine this treaty will be soon completed; if
any difficulty should arise, I shall take the advice of my
colleagues.</p>

<p>I thank you for the copies of Mr Paine's letter to the
Abb√© Raynal, which I have distributed to good hands.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
The errors we see in histories of our times and affairs
weaken our faith in ancient history. M. Hilliard d'Auberteuil
has here written another history of our revolution,
which however he modestly calls <em>an essay</em>, and fearing that
there may be errors, and wishing to have them corrected,
that his second edition may be more perfect, he has brought
me six sets, which he desires me to put into such hands in
America, as may be good enough to render him and the
public that service. I send them to you for that purpose,
by Captain Barney, desiring that one set may be given to
Mr Paine, and the rest where you please. There is a
quarto set in the parcel, which please to accept from me.</p>

<p>I have never learnt whether the box of books I sent to
you, and the press to Mr Thompson, were put on board
the Eagle or one of the transports. If the former, perhaps
you might easily purchase them at New York; if the latter,
you may still receive them among the goods for Congress,
now shipping by Mr Barclay. If they are quite lost let
me know it, that I may replace them.</p>

<p>I have received several letters from your office with bills
to pay Ministers' salaries. Nothing has yet been done with
those bills, but I have paid Mr Laurens 20,000 livres.</p>

<p>I have this day signed a common letter to you drawn up
by my colleagues, which you will receive herewith. We
have kept this vessel longer for two things, a passport promised
us from England, and a sum to send in her; but she
is likely to depart without both, being all of us impatient
that Congress should receive early intelligence of our proceedings,
and for the money we may probably borrow a
frigate.</p>

<p>I am now entering on my 78th year; public business
has engrossed fifty of them; I wish now to be, for the little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
time I have left, my own master. If I live to see this
peace concluded, I shall beg leave to remind the Congress
of their promise then to dismiss me. I shall be happy to
sing with old Simeon, <em>now lettest thou thy servant depart
in peace, for mine eyes have seen thy salvation</em>.</p>

Sir,
</p>

<p>I cannot but be surprised, Sir, that after the explanation
I have had with you, and the promise you gave, that
you would not press the application for an English passport
for the sailing of the packet Washington, that you
now inform me, you have received the passport, and that
at ten o'clock tomorrow morning your courier will set out

your conduct and that of your colleagues on this occasion.
You have concluded your preliminary articles without any
communication between us, although the instructions from
Congress prescribes, that nothing shall be done without the
participation of the King. You are about to hold out a
certain hope of peace to America, without even informing
yourself on the state of the negotiation on our part.</p>

<p>You are wise and discreet, Sir; you perfectly understand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
what is due to propriety; you have all your life performed
your duties. I pray you to consider how you
propose to fulfil those, which are due to the King? I am
not desirous of enlarging these reflections; I commit them
to your own integrity. When you shall be pleased to relieve
my uncertainty, I will entreat the King to enable me

<h3>TO COUNT DE VERGENNES.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">
Passy, December 17th, 1782.</p>

<p class="letter_open">
Sir,
</p>

<p>I received the letter your Excellency did me the honor
of writing to me on the 15th instant. The proposal of
having a passport from England was agreed to by me the
more willingly, as I at that time had hopes of obtaining
some money to send in the Washington, and the passport
would have made its transportation safer, with that of our despatches,
and of yours also, if you had thought fit to
make use of the occasion. Your Excellency objected, as
I understood it, that the English Ministers by their letters
sent in the same ship, might convey inconvenient expectations
into America. It was therefore I proposed not to
press for the passport, till your preliminaries were also
agreed to. They have sent the passport without being
pressed to do it, and they have sent no letters to go under
it, and ours will prevent the inconvenience apprehended.
In a subsequent conversation your Excellency mentioned
your intention of sending some of the King's cutters,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
whence I imagined, that detaining the Washington was no
longer necessary; and it was certainly incumbent on us to
give Congress as early an account as possible of our proceedings,
who will think it extremely strange to hear of
them by other means, without a line from us. I acquainted
your Excellency, however, with our intention of despatching
that ship, supposing you might possibly have something
to send by her.</p>

<p>Nothing has been agreed in the preliminaries contrary
to the interests of France; and no peace is to take place
between us and England, till you have concluded yours.
Your observation is, however, apparently just, that in not
consulting you before they were signed, we have been guilty
of neglecting a point of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">biens√©ance</i>. But as this was not
from want of respect for the King, whom we all love and
honor, we hope it will be excused, and that the great
work, which has hitherto been so happily conducted, is so
nearly brought to perfection, and is so glorious to his
reign, will not be ruined by a single indiscretion of ours.
And certainly the whole edifice sinks to the ground immediately,
if you refuse on that account to give us any further
assistance.</p>

<p>We have not yet despatched the ship, and I beg leave
to wait upon you on Friday for your answer.</p>

<p>It is not possible for any one to be more sensible than I
am, of what I and every American owe to the King, for
the many and great benefits and favors he has bestowed
upon us. All my letters to America are proofs of this;
all tending to make the same impressions on the minds of
my countrymen, that I felt in my own. And I believe,
that no Prince was ever more beloved and respected by
his own subjects, than the King is by the people of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
United States. <em>The English, I just now learn, flatter
themselves they have already divided us.</em> I hope this little
misunderstanding will therefore be kept a secret, and that
they will find themselves totally mistaken.</p>

<p class="letter_open">
Sir,
</p>

<p>Sundry circumstances occurring since mine of the 5th
and 14th, have hitherto retarded the departure of our despatches.
They will now go under the security of a British
passport, be accompanied by a sum of money, and by
some further intelligence from England, which shows the
still unsettled state of minds there, and, together with the
difficulties and small progress in the Dutch and Spanish
negotiations, makes the speedy conclusion of peace still uncertain.</p>

<p>The Swedish Ambassador has exchanged full powers
with me. I send a copy of his herewith. We have
had some conferences on the proposed plan of our treaty,
and he has despatched a courier for further instructions
respecting some of the articles.</p>

<p>The Commissioners have joined in a letter to you,
recommending the consideration of a proposal from Mr
Bridgen, relating to copper coin. With this you have a
copy of that proposal, and a sample of the copper. If it
should be accepted, I conceive the weight and value of the
pieces (charge of coinage deducted) should be such that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
they may be aliquot parts of a Spanish dollar. By the
copy enclosed, of an old letter of mine to Mr Bridgen,
you will see the ideas I had of the additional utility such a
coinage might be of, in communicating instruction.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<h3>ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON TO B. FRANKLIN.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">
Philadelphia, January 2d, 1783.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,
</p>

<p>I was honored with your letters by the Danae. I congratulate
you upon the promising state of our negotiations,
since peace begins to be no less desirable here than elsewhere.</p>

<p>But I will not enter into that subject at present, as I
mean to write very fully both to Mr Jay and you by Mr
Jefferson, who will sail in company with this frigate in the
Romulus, a ship of fortyfour guns. Lest, however, any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
accident should happen to prevent his arriving so soon as
the Emerald, I enclose a resolution of Congress, which
was suggested by the proposition you mention to have
been made to Mr Oswald, on the subject of commerce.
For my own part, I presume that it is already included in
your propositions, but as we have yet been favored only
with that short note of them, which has been transmitted
by you, we can form no accurate judgment on the subject.
You can hardly conceive the embarrassments that the
want of more minute details subjects us to.</p>

<p>You will learn from the Count de Rochambeau, that
the French army sailed the 24th ult. Perhaps it were
to be wished that they had remained here, at least till
New York and Charleston were evacuated, or rather till
the peace. Congress have, however, given them a good
word at parting, as you will see by the enclosed resolves.
Not being consulted, they could interpose no objections to
their departure, though they were not without many reasons
for wishing to detain them.</p>

<p>Our finances are still in great distress. If the war continues,
a foreign loan in addition to those already received
will be essential. A plan for ascertaining what shall be
called contingent expenses, is under the consideration of
Congress, as well as the objections you have stated with
respect to the mode of paying your salaries, which will, I
believe, be altered. The allowance to Mr Franklin has
been confirmed, and your moderation and his upon this
point have done you both honor in the opinion of Congress.</p>

<h3>ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON TO B. FRANKLIN.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">
Philadelphia, January 6th, 1783.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,
</p>

<p>I have before me your letters of the 25th and 29th of
June, 12th of August, 3d and 26th of September, and 14th
of October last. Several matters contained in them have
already been answered, and some others I am unable to
reply to, till Congress have decided on such propositions as
I have submitted to their consideration.</p>

<p>The convention relative to consuls has been objected to
by Mr Barclay, on account of its prohibiting the consuls
from trading. As the funds of Congress leave them no
means of affording an adequate support to persons who are
qualified, they fear, that the only inducement to accept the
appointment will be taken away by this prohibition. Mr Barclay's
letter on that subject is under consideration.</p>

<p>I see the force of your objections to soliciting the additional
twelve millions, and I feel very sensibly the weight
of our obligations to France, but every sentiment of this
kind must give way to our necessities. It is not for the
interest of our allies to lose the benefit of all they have
done, by refusing to make a small addition to it, or at least
to see the return that our commerce will make them suspended
by new convulsions in this country. The army
have chosen committees; a very respectable one is now with
Congress. They demand with importunity their arrears
of pay. The treasury is empty, and no adequate means
of filling it presents itself. The people pant for peace;
should contributions be exacted, as they have heretofore
been, at the point of the sword, the consequences may be
more dreadful than is at present apprehended. I do not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
pretend to justify the negligence of the States in not providing
greater supplies. Some of them might do more
than they have done; none of them all that is required.
It is my duty to confide to you, that if the war is continued
in this country, it must be in a great measure at the expense
of France. If peace is made, a loan will be absolutely
necessary to enable us to discharge the army, that
will not easily separate without pay. I am sorry that neither
Mr Jay nor you sent the propositions at large, as you
have made them, since we differ in opinion about the construction
to be put on your commercial article, as you
will find by a resolution enclosed in my letter.</p>

<p>I wish the concession made of our trade may be on conditions
of similar privileges on the part of Great Britain.
You will see that without this precaution, every ally that
we have, that is to be treated as the most favored nation,
may be entitled to the same privileges, even though they
do not purchase them by a reciprocal grant.</p>

<p>As to confiscated property, it is at present in such a
state, that the restoration of it is impossible. English debts
have not, that I know of, been forfeited, unless it be in one
State, and I should be extremely sorry to see so little integrity
in my countrymen, as to render the idea of withholding
them a general one; however, it would be well to
say nothing about them, if it can conveniently be done.</p>

<p>I am more and more convinced, that every means in
your power must be used to secure the fisheries. They
are essential to some States, and we cannot but hate the
nation, that keeps us from using this common favor of Providence.
It was one of the direct objects for carrying on
the war. While I am upon this subject, I cannot but express
my hope, that every means will be used to guard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
against any mistrusts or jealousies between you and France.
The United States have shown their confidence in her by
their instructions. She has repeatedly promised to procure
for us <em>all we ask</em>, as far as it lies in her power. Let
our conduct leave her without apology, if she acts otherwise,
which I am far from suspecting.</p>

<p>With respect to the seamen you mention, I wish if any
further order is necessary, than that which Mr Barclay already
has, that you would give it so far as to enable him
to state their accounts, and transmit them to Mr Morris.
As the treaty with Holland is concluded, I hope you have
made some progress in that with Sweden, a plan of which
has been transmitted; another copy will go by Mr Jefferson.</p>

<p>I am glad to find you have some prospect of obtaining
what is due on the Bon Homme Richard's prize money.
That matter has been much spoken of, and occasioned
some reflection, as it is alleged that M. Chaumont was imposed
on the officers as their agent by the Court, and of
course that they should be answerable for his conduct,
which certainly has been very exceptionable.</p>

<p>Congress have come to no determination, as to the size
or expense of the pillar they propose to erect at Yorktown.
What I wished of you was to send me one or two plans,
with estimates of the expense, in order to take their sense
thereon.</p>

<p>As to the designs of Spain, they are pretty well known,
and Mr Jay and Congress concur so exactly in sentiment
with respect to them, that I hope we have now nothing to
fear from that quarter.</p>

<p>Congress have it now under consideration to determine
what should be allowed as contingent expenses. I believe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
house-rent will not be allowed as such. I mentioned in
my last what respected your grandson, to which I have
nothing to add. I agree with you in sentiment, that your
salaries should not depend on the fluctuations of the exchange,
and have submitted that part of your letter to
Congress. I believe they will direct a stated sum to be
paid. Waiting for this determination, I am prevented from
drawing bills at this time. As to the money received from
me, you will be pleased to replace with it the two quarters'
salary you had drawn before it came to hand. You will
have bills for a third quarter, which have been sent on
some time since.</p>

<p>Several important political events have taken place here
lately. The evacuation of Charleston, the sailing of the
French fleet and the army, the decision of the great cause
between Connecticut and Pennsylvania, in favor of the
latter, the state of the army, &amp;c., all of which I should
enlarge upon, if this was not to be delivered by Mr Jefferson,
who will be able to inform you fully on these points
and many others, that you will deem important to a right
knowledge of the present state of this country.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>I enclose a state of the trade between these States and
the West Indies, as brought in by a Committee of Congress,
and referred to me. It may possibly afford you
some hints, and will serve to show how earnestly we wish
to have this market opened to us.</p>

I have the honor to be, &amp;c.</p>

trip to England; I heartily wish you a good journey,
and a speedy return, and request your kind care of a
packet for Mr Hodgson.</p>

<p>I enclose two papers, that were read at different times
by me to the Commissioners; they may serve to show, if
you should have occasion, what was urged on the part of
America on certain points; or may help to refresh your
memory. I send you also another paper, which I once
read to you separately. It contains a proposition for improving
the law of nations, by prohibiting the plundering
of unarmed and usefully employed people. I rather wish
than expect, that it will be adopted. But I think it may
be offered with a better grace by a country, that is likely to
suffer least and gain most by continuing the ancient practice;
which is our case, as the American ships, laden only
with the gross productions of the earth, cannot be so valuable
as yours, filled with sugars or with manufactures.
It has not yet been considered by my colleagues, but if
you should think or find that it might be acceptable on
your side, I would try to get it inserted in the general
treaty. I think it will do honor to the nations that establish
it.</p>

<p>With great and sincere esteem, I am, Sir, your most
obedient and most humble servant,</p>

<p class="center"><em>Propositions relative to Privateering, communicated to
Mr Oswald.</em></p>

<p>It is for the interest of humanity in general, that the
occasions of war, and the inducements to it should be
diminished.</p>

<p>If rapine is abolished, one of the encouragements to war
is taken away, and peace therefore more likely to continue
and be lasting.</p>

<p>The practice of robbing merchants on the high seas, a
remnant of the ancient piracy, though it may be accidentally
beneficial to particular persons, is far from being profitable
to all engaged in it, or to the nation that authorises it.
In the beginning of a war, some rich ships, not upon their
guard, are surprised and taken. This encourages the
first adventurers to fit out more armed vessels, and many
others to do the same. But the enemy at the same time
become more careful, arm their merchant ships better, and
render them not so easy to be taken; they go also more
under protection of convoys; thus while the privateers to
take them are multiplied, the vessels subject to be taken,
and the chances of profit, are diminished, so that many
cruises are made, wherein the expenses overgo the gains;
and as is the case in other lotteries, though particulars
have got prizes, the mass of adventurers are losers, the
whole expense of fitting out all the privateers, during a
war, being much greater than the whole amount of goods
taken. Then there is the national loss of all the labor of
so many men during the time they have been employed in
robbing; who besides spend what they get in riot, drunkenness,
and debauchery, lose their habits of industry, are
rarely fit for any sober business after a peace, and serve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
only to increase the number of highwaymen and housebreakers.
Even the undertakers, who have been fortunate,
are by sudden wealth led into expensive living,
the habit of which continues when the means of supporting
it ceases, and finally ruins them; a just punishment
for their having wantonly and unfeelingly ruined many
honest innocent traders and their families, whose subsistence
was employed in serving the common interests of
mankind.</p>

<p>Should it be agreed and become a part of the law of
nations, that the cultivators of the earth are not to be
molested or interrupted in their peaceable and useful employment,
the inhabitants of the sugar islands would perhaps
come under the protection of such a regulation,
which would be a great advantage to the nations who at
present hold those islands, since the cost of sugar to the
consumer in those nations, consists not merely in the price
he pays for it by the pound, but in the accumulated
charge of all the taxes he pays in every war, to fit out
fleets and maintain troops for the defence of the islands
that raise the sugar, and the ships that bring it home. But
the expense of treasure is not all. A celebrated philosophical
writer remarks, that when he considered the wars
made in Africa, for prisoners to raise sugars in America,
the numbers slain in those wars, the numbers that, being
crowded in ships, perish in the transportation, and the
numbers that die under the severities of slavery, he could
scarce look on a morsel of sugar without conceiving it
spotted with human blood. If he had considered also the
blood of one another, which the white nations shed in
fighting for those islands, he would have imagined his sugar
not as spotted only, but as thoroughly dyed red. On these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
accounts I am persuaded, that the subjects of the Emperor
of Germany, and the Empress of Russia, who have
no sugar islands, consume sugar cheaper at Vienna, and
Moscow, with all the charge of transporting it after its
arrival in Europe, than the citizens of London or of Paris.
And I sincerely believe, that if France and England were
to decide, by throwing dice, which should have the whole
of their sugar islands, the loser in the throw would be the
gainer. The future expense of defending them would
be saved; the sugars would be bought cheaper by all
Europe, if the inhabitants might make it without interruption,
and whoever imported the sugar, the same revenue
might be raised by duties at the custom houses of the nation
that consumed it. And, on the whole, I conceive it
would be better for the nations now possessing sugar colonies
to give up their claim to them, let them govern themselves,
and put them under the protection of all the powers
of Europe as neutral countries, open to the commerce
of all, the profits of the present monopolies being by no
means equivalent to the expense of maintaining them.</p>

<p class="letter_open">
My Dearest Sir,
</p>

<p>I cannot but in the most earnest manner, and from
recent circumstances, press your going early to Versailles
tomorrow; and I have considerable reason to think, that
your appearance there will not displease the person whom
you address. I am of opinion, that it is very likely that
you will have the glory of having concluded the peace by
this visit; at least I am sure, if the deliberations of tomorrow
evening end unfavorably, that there is the strongest
appearance of war; if they end favorably, perhaps little
difficulty may attend the rest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>After all, the peace will have as much that is conceded
in it, as England can in any shape be made just
now to relish, owing to the stubborn demands, principally
of Spain, who would not, I believe, upon any motive
recede from her conquests. What I wrote about
Gibraltar arrived after the subject, as I understand, was
canvassed, and when it of course must have appeared
impolitic eagerly and immediately to revive it.</p>

<p>You reproved me, or rather reproved a political scheme
yesterday, of which I have heard more said favorably
by your friends at Paris, than by any persons whatever in
London. But do you, my dear Sir, make this peace, and
trust our common sense respecting another war. England,
said a man of sense to me the other day, will come
out of the war like a convalescent out of disease, and must
be re-established by some physic and much regimen. I
cannot easily tell in what shape a bankruptcy would come
upon England, and still less easily in what mode and degree
it would affect us; but if your confederacy mean to
bankrupt us now, I am sure we shall lose the great fear
that would deter us from another war. Your allies, therefore,
for policy and for humanity's sake, will, I hope, stop
short of this extremity; especially as we should do some
mischief to others, as well as to ourselves.</p>

<h3>JOHN JAY TO B. FRANKLIN.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">
Paris, January 26th, 1783.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,
</p>

<p>It having been suspected, that I concurred in the appointment
of your grandson to the place of Secretary to
the American commission for peace <em>at your instance</em>, I
think it right, thus unsolicited, to put it in your power to
correct the mistake.</p>

<p>Your general character, the opinion I had long entertained
of your services to our country, and the friendly
attention and aid with which you had constantly favored
me after my arrival in Spain, impressed me with a desire
of manifesting both my esteem and attachment by stronger
evidence than professions. That desire extended my regard
for you to your grandson. He was then indeed a
stranger to me, but the terms in which you expressed
to Congress your opinion of his being qualified for another
place of equal importance, were so full and satisfactory, as
to leave me no room to doubt of his being qualified for the
one above mentioned. I was, therefore, happy to assure
you, in one of the first letters I afterwards wrote you from
Spain, that in case a Secretary to our commission for
peace should become necessary, and the appointment be
left to us, I should take that opportunity of evincing my
regard for you, by nominating him, or words to that effect.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
What I then wrote, was the spontaneous suggestion of my
own mind, unsolicited, and I believe unexpected by you.</p>

<p>When I came here on the business of that commission,
I brought with me the same intentions, and should always
have considered myself engaged by honor, as well as inclination,
to fulfil them, unless I had found myself mistaken
in the opinion I had imbibed of that young gentleman's
character and qualifications; but that not being the case, I
found myself at liberty to indulge my wishes, and be as
good as my word. For I expressly declare, that your
grandson is, in my opinion, qualified for the place in question,
and that, if he had not been, no consideration would
have prevailed upon me to propose, or join in his appointment.</p>

<p>This explicit and unreserved statement of facts is due
to you, to him, and to justice, and you have my consent to
make any use of it that you may think proper.</p>

<p>As I know you are on the point of making a tour to
France, I cannot omit warmly recommending to you to
endeavor, during your stay at Paris, to gain as much as
possible, the confidence and esteem of Mr Franklin.</p>

<p>You will recollect, Sir, what I said to you in our conversations,
of the high respect which all the King's Ministry
have for that Minister. You have witnessed the satisfaction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
with which we have learned the glorious issue of this
war for the United States of America, and how fully we are
persuaded, that it will be for the general interest of the two
States to form, as soon as possible, reciprocal connexions
of friendship and commerce. Nothing, certainly, would
be more agreeable to us, than to learn by your letters, that
you find the same dispositions in Mr Franklin, and in that
case it seems to me the shortest way of accelerating these
new connexions would be to take the treaty between the
Congress and the States-General for the basis, and that
Mr Franklin should communicate to us his ideas on the
changes or additions which he might think reciprocally
useful in the treaty of commerce, which Congress might
conclude with us.</p>

<p>We should eagerly and frankly reply to such overtures;
and, as soon as the changes thus agreed on

might, in order to gain time, come here with full powers to
conclude, leaving on both sides the most particular stipulations
for the negotiations of the Ministers which those

<h3>DAVID HARTLEY TO B. FRANKLIN.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">
London, March 12th, 1783.</p>
<p class="letter_open">
My Dear Friend,
</p>

<p>It is a long while since I have heard from you, or indeed
since I wrote to you. I heartily congratulate you on those
pacific events, which have already happened, and I wish to
see all other final steps of conciliation succeed speedily. I
send you copies of two papers, which I have already communicated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
to Mr Laurens; the one called <em>Conciliatory
Propositions, in March, 1783</em>; the other <em>A Sketch of a
Provisional Treaty of Commerce for opening the Ports between
Great Britain and the United States of America
without Delay</em>; to each of which is prefixed a short state of
the argument on each head.</p>

<p>As for the news of this country, you have doubtless
heard, that Lord Shelburne's administration has for some
time been considered as at an end; although no other has
been as yet substituted in the place of it. It was understood
yesterday, and I believe with good foundation, that
what is now called the Portland party have been applied
to, and they are now considered as the party most likely
to succeed. As far as my wishes go, such an event would
be most satisfactory to me. I have known the Duke of
Portland for many years, and by experience I know him to
be a nobleman of the strictest honor, and of the soundest
whig principles, sincere and explicit in every thought and
transaction, manly in his judgment, and firm in his conduct.
The kingdom of Ireland, of which he was lately Lord Lieutenant,
bears unanimous testimony to this character of him.
The Cavendish family, (a good whig name) Mr Fox, Lord
Fitzwilliam, &amp;c. &amp;c. form the core of his system and connexions.
I most earnestly wish to see a firm administration
upon a whig foundation, which I should consider as a solid
basis, on the part of this country, for a perpetual correspondence
of amity and conciliation with America. I am
very anxious to hear of your health. God bless you.</p>

<p>
Ever your most affectionate,</p>

<p class="signature">D. HARTLEY.</p>


<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>
<p class="center"><em>Conciliatory Propositions, March, 1783.</em></p>

<p>Terms of peace having been agreed upon between Great
Britain and France, on the 20th of January, 1783, there
need not be any further delay in proceeding to conclude
the proposed treaty between Great Britain and the United
States of America, upon the basis of the provisional articles
of the 30th of November, 1782.</p>

<p>It is to be observed, that none of the articles of the provisional
treaty are to take effect, until the conclusion of the
definitive treaty with America, at which time likewise all
places in the American States, in possession of the British
arms, are to be evacuated, and the British army withdrawn
from the United States (by article 7.) If therefore it
should be wished on the part of Great Britain to bring forward
the fifth article respecting the loyalists, before the conclusion
of the definitive treaty with America, the bayonet
should be withdrawn from the American breast, by the voluntary
removal of the British troops with all convenient
despatch. This condition of the removal of the troops is
likewise necessary, before any provisional terms of commerce
with America can take place.</p>

<p>By the 6th article of the provisional treaty, all future
confiscations in America are precluded, although the prosecutions
at present subsisting are not to be stopped before
the definitive treaty. But if the substantial pledge of returning
amity on the part of Great Britain, viz. the removal
of the troops should be voluntarily anticipated, it would be
but reasonable that all prosecutions should be immediately
abated on the part of America; and to facilitate the removal
of the troops, the loyalists may be permitted to
remain in safety and unmolested, (if they choose to remain)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
from the period of removing the troops, until twelve months
after the definitive treaty.</p>

<p>There is another article of the provisional treaty, the delay
of which is much to be lamented, viz. the mutual
release of prisoners of war on both sides. As this is an
article of reciprocity, both sides from principles of humanity
are equally interested to bring it forward into effect
speedily, that those unhappy captives may not alone suffer
the miseries of war in the time of peace.</p>

<p>Upon these considerations, the following supplemental
terms of a treaty between Great Britain and the United
States are proposed.</p>

<p>1. That the British troops shall be withdrawn with all
convenient speed.</p>

<p>2. That the commissioners on both sides do proceed to
the conclusion of the definitive treaty.</p>

<p>3. That the commissioners do speedily negotiate a provisional
convention of commerce (hereunto annexed) to take
place immediately. The terms of this temporary convention,
not to be pleaded on either side in the negotiation of
final and perpetual treaty of commerce, between Great
Britain and the United States.</p>

<p>4. That the commissioners do negotiate a perpetual
treaty of commerce.</p>

<p>5. That all prosecutions of the loyalists in America be
immediately abated, and that they be permitted to remain
until twelve months after the definitive treaty, unmolested
in their endeavors to obtain restitution of their estates.</p>

<p>6. That all prisoners on both sides be immediately released.</p>

<p>7. That intercourse of amity and commerce do immediately
take place between Great Britain and the United
States of America.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>
<p class="center"><em>Sketch of a Provisional Treaty of Commerce.</em></p>

<p>As soon as preliminaries of peace are signed with any
independent States, such as Spain, France, and Holland,
the course of mutual commerce emerges upon the same
terms and conditions as were existing antecedent to the
war, the new duties imposed during the war excepted.
The case between Great Britain and America is different,
because America, from a dependent nation before the war,
emerges an independent nation after the war. The basis,
therefore, of a provisional treaty between Great Britain and
the United States would be simply to arrange such points
as would emerge after the war, impracticable and discordant
to the newly established independence of the American
States, and to leave all others, as much as possible, untouched.
For instance, that all instrumental regulations,
such as papers, bonds, certificates, oaths, and all other
documents should be, between Great Britain and the
United States, upon the same footing, and no other than
as between Great Britain and any other independent
nation, but that all duties, drawbacks, bounties, rights,
privileges, and all pecuniary considerations, should emerge
into action and effect as before. I say emerge as before,
not stipulated for any fixed term, because I am speaking
of a provisional <em>treaty</em>, not of a provisional <em>bill</em> of commerce,
for a specified period. By this means, all difficulties,
which otherwise would be accumulated, and
obstruct a temporary and provisional act are avoided <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in
limine</i>. The ports will be immediately opened, upon
specified and known conditions. If the legislature of
either country thinks proper to introduce on its own part
any new conditions or regulations, even previous to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
intended treaty of commerce, that will not shut the ports
again generally but only operate <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pro tanto</i> according to the
case; on which side soever any novel condition should
arise, the other will likewise be at liberty to make any corresponding
regulations as between independent nations.
The great object is to open the ports between Great Britain
and the United States, immediately on the signature
of preliminaries of peace, as between France and Great
Britain. By the proposition above stated, Great Britain
and France, and Great Britain and the United States respectively,
on the subject of intercourse of commerce,
would emerge again after the war into situations relatively
similar to their situation before the war.</p>

<p>The Crown of Great Britain is enabled by the Conciliatory
Act of 1782 to repeal, annul, make void, or suspend,
for any time or times, the operation and effect of any act
of Parliament, or any clause, provision, matter, or thing
therein contained, relating to the colonies or plantations
now become the United States of America; and, therefore,
the crown is not only competent to conclude, but
likewise to carry into effect any provisional treaty of commerce
with America. The first foundation must be laid
in the total repeal of the Prohibitory Act of December,
1775, not only as prohibiting commerce between Great
Britain and the United States, but as the corner stone of
the war; by giving up universally all American property
at sea to military plunder, without any redress to be obtained
by law in any British Court of Admiralty. After
this, all obstructions from the act of navigation and other
acts regulating the commerce of the States of America
(formerly dependent upon Great Britain,) may be removed.
Instructions may be sent to the Commissioners of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
the customs to dispense with bonds, certificates, &amp;c. which
by the old laws are required to be discharged or attested
by supposed governors, naval or customhouse officers in
America. The questions of drawbacks, bounties, &amp;c.
after opening the ports, may remain free points of discussion
and regulation, as between States having no commercial
treaty subsisting between them. As the Crown is competent
to open an intercourse of commerce with America
by treaty, this mode is preferable to any act of Parliament,
which may be only a jealous and suspicious convention
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex parte</i>. This mode by treaty avoids the accumulated
difficulties, which might otherwise obstruct the first
opening of the ports by act of Parliament, and above all,
it secures an alternate binding part of the bargain, which
no act of Parliament can do.</p>

<p>Breviate of the treaty, viz. Provisional for intercourse
and commerce between Great Britain and the United
States of America.</p>

<p>1. That all ports shall be mutually open for intercourse
and commerce.</p>

<p>2. And therefore the King of Great Britain agrees to
the repeal of the prohibitory acts, viz. 16 Geo. 3, chap. 5,
&amp;c. The King of Great Britain likewise agrees by instructions,
according to the laws of Great Britain, to his
Commissioners of customs and other officers, to remove all
obstructions to American ships either entering inwards or
clearing outwards, which may arise from any acts of Parliament
heretofore regulating the commerce of the American
States, under the description of British colonies or
plantations, so as to accommodate every circumstance to
the reception of their ships, as the ships of independent
States.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>3. All duties, drawbacks, bounties, rights, privileges,
and all other money considerations shall remain, respecting
the United States of America, upon the same footing as
they now remain respecting the province of Nova Scotia in
America, or as if the aforesaid States had remained dependent
upon Great Britain. All this subject to regulations
or alterations by any future acts of the Parliament of
Great Britain.</p>

<p>4. On the part of the States of America, it is agreed
that all laws prohibiting the commerce of Great Britain
shall be repealed.</p>

<p>5. Agreed upon the same part, that all ships, and
merchandise of the British dominions shall be admitted
upon the same terms as before the war, except any
imposts laid during the war. All this subject to future
regulations or alterations by the legislatures of the American
States respectively.</p>

<p>6. The principles and spirit of this treaty to be supported
on either side by any necessary supplemental arrangements.
No tacit compliance on the part of America
in any subordinate points to be argued at any time hereafter
to the prejudice of their independence.</p>

Passy, March 23d, 1783.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Dear Sir,
</p>

<p>I received the letter you did me the honor of writing to
me, requesting a recommendation to America, of Mr Joshua
Grigby. I have accordingly written one, and having
an opportunity the other day, I sent it under cover to Mr Benjamin
Vaughan. The general proclamations you wished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
for suspending, or rather putting an end to hostilities, are now
published; so that your "heart is at rest," and mine with it.
You may depend on my joining my hearty endeavors with
yours, in "cultivating conciliatory principles between our two
countries;" and I may venture to assure you, that if your
bill for a provisional establishment of the commerce had
passed as at first proposed, a stipulation on our part in the
definitive treaty, to allow reciprocal and equal advantages
and privileges to your subjects, would have been readily
agreed to.</p>

<p>
With great and sincere esteem, I am ever, &amp;c.</p>

<h3>ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON TO B. FRANKLIN.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">
Philadelphia, March 26th, 1783.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,
</p>

<p>I need hardly tell you, that the intelligence brought
by the Washington diffused a general pleasure. We had
long been in suspense with respect to the negotiations, and
had received no other lights on that subject, than those the
speech of his Britannic Majesty and Mr Townshend's
letters threw upon it. These were by no means sufficient
to dissipate all our apprehensions.</p>

<p>The terms you have obtained for us comprise most of
the objects we wish for. I am sorry, however, that you
found it necessary to act with reserve, and to conceal your
measures from the Court of France. I am fearful that
you will not be able to produce such facts, as will justify
this conduct to the world, or free us from the charge of
ingratitude to a friend, who has treated us not only justly
but generously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>But this is a disagreeable subject, and I refer you for
my sentiments, and those of Congress, to my letter, in
answer to the joint letter from our Ministers. I am sorry
that the commercial article is stricken out; it would have
been very important to us to have got footing at least in
the British West Indies, as a means of compelling France
to pursue her true interest and ours, by opening her ports
also to us.</p>

<p>We have just learned by a vessel from Cadiz, that the
preliminary articles for a general peace were signed the
20th. The abstract of the treaty sent me by the Marquis
de Lafayette, does the highest honor to the moderation
and wisdom of France. Never has she terminated a war
with more glory, and in gaining nothing but that trophy
of victory, Tobago, she has established a character, which
confirms her friends, disarms her enemies, and obtains a
reputation that is of more value than any territorial acquisitions
she could make.</p>

<p>We have been in great distress with respect to our
army. Pains were taken to inflame their minds, and
make them uneasy at the idea of a peace, which left them
without support. Inflammatory papers were dispersed in
camp, calling them together to determine upon some mad
action. The general interposed, postponed the meeting to
a future day, on which he met them, and made them an
address, that will do him more honor than his victories.
After which they passed several resolves, becoming a patriot
army. Congress are seriously engaged in endeavoring
to do them justice. I am in great hopes, that we shall
shortly be brought back to such a situation, as to be enabled
to enjoy the blessings you have laid the foundation of.</p>

<p>I received from Mr Franklin the papers relative to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
Portuguese vessel, which I have caused to be laid before
the Court of Appeals, where the cause is now depending.
The cargo having been condemned, and the yacht acquitted
at Boston, I doubt not but full justice will be done to
the proprietors on the rehearing. You know so much of
our constitution as to see, that it is impossible to interfere
further in these matters, than by putting the evidence in a
proper train to be examined. I have had the proceedings
in the case of the brig Providentia transmitted to me from
Boston, with a full state of the evidence, which I have
examined. The cargo is condemned and the vessel acquitted,
an allowance for freight having been made by the
court. The evidence does not admit a doubt of the justice
of this decree. Should the Court of Denmark not
be satisfied with this account, I will cause a copy of the
proceedings to be transmitted to you for their satisfaction.
I hope this mark of attention to them will induce them to
acknowledge the injustice they have done us, in the detention
of our prizes. This object should not be lost
sight of.</p>

<p>I thank you for your present of M. d'Auberteuil's Essay,
and shall dispose of the copies he has sent in the way you
recommend. I could hardly have believed it possible,
that so many errors and falsehoods, that would shock the
strongest faith on this side of the water, could be received
as orthodox on the other.</p>

<p>I remit bills for the salaries of our Ministers. It is impossible,
that I can adjust their accounts here; you must
settle with them, and they repay you out of the drafts I
have made in their favor when they have been overpaid.
Congress have, in pursuance of your sentiment, in your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
letter of October, passed the enclosed resolution.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> So
that on the quarter's salary due in April, there will be a
deduction of all you gained by the course of exchange;
and the payments will be reduced to par, at which rate
they will always be paid in future. This deduction
amounts on your salary to eight thousand three hundred
and thirtysix livres, as will appear from the account that
will be stated by Mr Morris. I shall pay your bills into
the hands of Mr Robert Morris, whom you have constituted
your agent. The bills for the other gentlemen, who
may not be with you, are committed to your care. As the
bills are drawn in their favor, they can only be paid on
their endorsement.</p>

<p>Congress will, I believe, agree very reluctantly to let
you quit their service. The subject, together with Mr
Adams's and Mr Laurens's resignation, is under the consideration
of a committee. If they report before this vessel
sails, you shall know their determination.</p>

<p>On the arrival of the Triumph from Cadiz, which
brought orders for recalling the cruisers of his Britannic
Majesty, Congress passed the enclosed resolution, which
I transmitted with the intelligence we had received to
Carleton and Digby. I sent my Secretary with my letters,
and expect him back this evening. I am anxious to
know how the first messenger of peace has been received<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
by them, as well as to discover through him what steps
they propose to take for the evacuation.</p>

<p>I ought to thank you for your journal before I conclude.
The perusal of it afforded me great pleasure. I must
pray you to continue it. I much wish to have every step,
which led to so interesting an event as the treaty, which
established our Independence. And though both Mr Jay
and Mr Adams are minute in their journals, for which I
am much obliged to them, yet new light may be thrown
on the subject by you, who, having been longer acquainted
with the Courts both of London and Versailles, have the
means of more information relative to their principles and
measures.</p>

<p>
I have the honor to be, Sir, &amp;c.</p>

<h3>FROM THE CITY OF HAMBURG TO CONGRESS.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></h3>

<h4>Translation.</h4>

<p class="letter_head">
March 29th, 1783.</p>

<p>Right Noble, High, Mighty, Most Honorable Lords,
</p>

<p>Since, by the preliminary articles of peace, concluded
lately between the high belligerent powers, the illustrious United
States of North America have been acknowledged free,
sovereign, and independent, and now since European powers
are courting in rivalry the friendship of your High
Mightinesses,</p>

<p>We, impressed with the most lively sensations on the
illustrious event, the wonder of this, and the most remote<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
future ages, and desirous fully to testify the part which we
take therein, do hereby offer your High Mightinesses our
service and attachment to the cause.</p>

<p>And in the most sincere disposition of heart, we take the
honor to wish, so as from Omnipotent Providence we do
pray, that the most illustrious republic of the United States
of America may, during the remotest centuries, enjoy all
imaginable advantages to be derived from that sovereignty,
which they gained by prudence and courage.</p>

<p>That, by the wisdom and active patriotism of your illustrious
Congress, it may forever flourish and increase, and
that the High and Mighty Regents of those free United
States may, with ease and in abundance, enjoy all manner of
temporal happiness; and at the same time we most obsequiously
recommend our city to a perpetual friendly intelligence,
and her trade and navigation in matters reciprocally
advantageous to your favor and countenance.</p>

<p>In order to show that such mutual commerce with the
merchant houses of this place may undoubtedly be of common
benefit, your High Mightinesses will be pleased to give
us leave to mark out some advantages of this trading city.</p>

<p>Here reigns a free unrestrained republican commerce,
charged with but few duties.</p>

<p>Hamburg's situation upon the river Elbe is, as if it were
in the centre of the Baltic and the North Sea, and as canals
are cut from the river through the city, goods may be
brought in ships to the magazines in town, and from thence
again to all parts of the world.</p>

<p>Hamburg carries on its trade with economy. It is the
mart of goods of all countries, where they can be purchased
not only of good quality, but sometimes cheaper than at
first hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>Here linen, woollen goods, calicoes, glass, copper and
all other numerous produce of manufactured wares of the
whole German Empire, are brought in by Portuguese,
Spaniards, the English, Dutch, French, and other nations,
and from hence further transported. In exchange whereof,
considerable quantities of North American goods, much
wanted in Germany, may be taken.</p>

<p>M. Penet, who in your country is honored with several
offices, has sojourned here for some time, and with all who
had the honor of his acquaintance, borne the character of
an intelligent, skilful, and for reciprocally advantageous
commerce, a well disposed and zealous man, will certainly
have the complaisance to give your High Mightinesses further
explanation of the advantages of this trading place,
which we have but briefly touched upon.</p>

<p>We now intercessionally and most obsequiously request
your High Mightinesses to favor and countenance the trade
of our merchants, and to suffer them to enjoy all such
rights and liberties as you allow to merchants of nations in
amity; which in gratitude and with zeal we will in our
place endeavor to retribute, not doubting that such mutual
intercourse may be effected, since a good beginning thereof
is already made on both sides, by the friendly reception
of the vessels that have arrived in either country.</p>

<p>In further testimony of our most attentive obsequiousness
and sincere attachment, we have deputed our citizen,
John Abraham de Boor, who is charged with the concerns
of a considerable merchant house, which, like several other
merchant houses of good report and solidity in this city, is
desirous of entering with merchants of your country into
reciprocal commerce. He is to have the honor to present
to your High Mightinesses this our most obsequious missive;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
wherefore we most earnestly recommend him to
your favorable reception. He has it from us in express
charge, most respectfully to give your High Mightinesses,
if required, such upright and accurate accounts of our situation
and constitutions, as may be depended upon, and at
the same time in person to testify the assurance of the
most perfect respect and attachment, with which attentively
we remain, Right Noble, High, Mighty, and most
honorable Lords, your most obsequious and devoted Burgomaster
and Senate of the Imperial free City of Hamburg.</p>

<p>Given under our City Seal, the 29th of March, 1783.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />


<p class="letter_head">London, March 31st, 1783.</p>
<p class="letter_open">My dear Friend,
</p>

<p>I send you a paper entitled <cite>Supplemental Treaty</cite>, the
substance of which I sent you some time ago, as I read it
in part of a speech in the House of Commons. I have
given a copy of it to Mr L., as the grounds upon which
my friend, the Duke of Portland, would have wished that
any administration, in which he might have taken a part,
should have treated with the American Ministers. All
negotiations for the formation of a Ministry in concert
with the Duke of Portland are at an end.</p>

<p>The tenth article, which is supposed to be referred to
the definitive treaty, is a renewal of the same proposition,
which I moved in Parliament some years ago, viz. on the
9th of April, 1778. I see nothing inconsistent with that
proposition, either in the declaration of independence or
in the treaty with France. Let it therefore remain,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
and emerge after the war, as a point untouched by the
war. I assure you my consent should not be wanting
to extend this principle between all the nations upon
earth. I know full well, that those nations to which you
and I are bound by birth and consanguinity, would reap
the earliest fruits from it. <em>Owing no man hate, and
envying no man's happiness</em>, I should rejoice in the lot
of my own country, and on her part say to America,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nos duo turba sumus</i>. I send you, likewise, enclosed
with this, some sentiments respecting the principles of
some late negotiations, drawn up in the shape of Parliamentary
motions by my brother, who joins with me in
the sincerest good wishes to you for health and happiness,
and for the peace of our respective countries, and of mankind.</p>

<p>
Your ever affectionate,</p>

</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p class="center"><em>Supplemental Treaty between Great Britain and the
United States of North America.</em></p>

<p>1. That the British troops be withdrawn from the United
States with all convenient speed.</p>

<p>2. That all further prosecutions of loyalists in America
be immediately abated, and that they be permitted to remain
until twelve months after the definitive treaty with
America in safety and unmolested, in their endeavors to
obtain restitution of their estates.</p>

<p>3. That all ports shall be mutually opened for intercourse
and commerce, between Great Britain and the
United States.</p>

<p>4. Agreed on the part of Great Britain, that all Prohibitory
Acts shall be repealed, and that all obstructions to
American ships, either entering inwards or clearing outwards,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
shall be removed, which may arise from any acts
of Parliament, heretofore regulating the commerce of the
American States, under the description of British Colonies
and Plantations, so as to accommodate every circumstance
to the reception of their ships, as the ships of independent
States.</p>

<p>5. Agreed on the part of Great Britain, that all duties,
rights, privileges, and all pecuniary considerations shall
remain, respecting the United States of America, upon the
same footing as they now remain respecting the Province
of Nova Scotia, or as if the said States had remained dependent
upon Great Britain. All this subject to regulations
and alterations by any future acts of the Parliament
of Great Britain.</p>

<p>6. On the part of the American States it is agreed,
that all laws prohibiting commerce with Great Britain shall
be repealed.</p>

<p>7. Agreed on the part of the American States, that all
ships and merchandise of the British dominions shall be
admitted upon the same terms as before the war. All
this subject to future regulations or alterations by the
Legislatures of the American States respectively.</p>

<p>8. That all prisoners on both sides be immediately released.</p>

<p>9. The spirit and principles of this treaty to be supported
on either side by any necessary supplemental arrangements.
No tacit compliance on the part of the
American States in any subordinate points to be urged at
any time hereafter in derogation of their independence.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p class="center"><em>Separate Article to be referred to the Definitive Treaty.</em></p>

<p>10. Neither shall the independence of the United States<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
be construed any further than as independence, absolute
and unlimited in matters of government, as well as commerce.
Not into alienation, and therefore the subjects of
his Britannic Majesty and the citizens of the United
States shall mutually be considered as natural born subjects,
and enjoy all rights and privileges as such in the
respective dominions and territories, in the manner heretofore
accustomed.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p class="center"><em>Paper mentioned in the Close of Mr Hartley's Letter.</em></p>

<p>1. That it is the opinion of this House, that whenever
Great Britain thought proper to acknowledge the independence
of America, the mode of putting it into effect most
honorably for this country, would have been, to have made
the declaration of independence previous to the commencement
of any treaty with any other power.</p>

<p>2. That a deviation from that line of conduct, has the
effect of appearing to grant the independence of America
solely to the demands of the House of Bourbon, and not,
as was the real state of the case, from a change in the sentiments
of this country, as to the object and continuance
of the American war.</p>

<p>3. That when this House, by its vote against the further
prosecution of offensive war in America, had given up the
point of contest, and adopted a conciliatory disposition, the
pursuing those principles by an immediate and liberal negotiation
upon the basis of independence, at the same time
expressing a readiness to conclude a general peace with
the allies of America upon honorable terms, would have
been the most likely way to promote a mutual and beneficial
intercourse between the two countries; to establish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
peace upon a firm foundation; and would have prevented
the House of Bourbon from having a right to claim any
further obligations from America, as the assertors of their
independence.</p>

<p>4. That the Minister, who advised the late negotiations
for peace, has neglected to make use of those advantages,
which the determination of the House put him in possession
of; that, by his delay in authorising persons properly
to negotiate with the American Commissioners, he has
shown a reluctance to acting upon the liberal principles of
granting independence to America, as the determination of
Great Britain upon mature consideration of the question;
and has by such methods given advantage to the enemies
of this country to promote and confirm that commerce and
connexion between the United States of America and
themselves, which during the contest have been turned
from their natural channel with this country, and which
this peace so concluded has not yet contributed to restore.</p>

<p class="letter_head">
Algiers, April 1st, 1783.</p>
<p class="letter_open">
Sir,
</p>

<p>The imminent danger to which the vessels of your
nation were exposed, which sailed in March last from
Marseilles, and which owed their safety to the god of the
seas alone, emboldens me to call your attention to this
point.</p>

<p>Some secret enemies, (whom I know) having giving information
to this regency of their departure, nine armed
ships immediately sailed to wait for them at Cape Palos.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
It is to be presumed that the Americans had passed the
Straits.</p>

<p>Algiers has many ships, and the politics of certain European
powers do not restrain them from paying tribute to
enjoy peace; they make use of these human harpies as a
terror to the belligerent nations, whose commerce they
chain to the car of Algerine piracy. We saw an example
of this, when his Imperial Majesty, to protect his flag,
made use of the Firman of the Sublime Porte. It was
attacked, and five prizes were brought into this port in
1781, four of which with ballast were restored in February,
1782, at the claim of a Capapigi Bashaw of the Porte,
and of M. Timone, the Imperial Agent, who was expelled,
and whose correspondent I am, having been his Secretary
on this occasion, and having revealed to his Highness,
Prince Kaunitz Rietberg, Minister at the Court of Vienna,
horrors and crimes which would have remained unpunished
but for my pen.</p>

<p>Humanity alone, Sir, has engaged me to give you this advice.
I request you will be pleased to keep it secret; your
prudence will effect what may be necessary on this occasion.</p>

<p>I have the honor to offer you every information respecting
this port, and flatter myself that I shall succeed therein.
I think to depart from this in May or June next for Marseilles,
and to leave these barbarian pirates.</p>

<h3>TO M. ROSENCRONE.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">
Passy, April 13th, 1783.</p>
<p class="letter_open">Sir,
</p>

<p>Monsieur de Walterstorff has communicated to me a
letter from your Excellency, which affords me great pleasure,
as it expresses in clear and strong terms the good disposition
of your Court<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> to form connexions of friendship
and commerce with the United States of America. I am
confident that the same good disposition will be found in
the Congress; and having acquainted that respectable
body with the purport of your letter, I expect a commission
will soon be sent, appointing some person in Europe
to enter into a treaty with his Majesty the King of
Denmark for the purpose desired.</p>

<p>In the meantime, to prepare and forward the business as
much as may be, I send, for your Excellency's consideration,
such a sketch as you mention, formed on the basis of
our treaty with Holland, on which I shall be glad to receive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
your Excellency's sentiments. And I hope that this
transaction when completed, may be the means of producing
and securing a long and happy friendship between
our two nations.</p>

<p>To smooth the way for obtaining this desirable end, as
well as to comply with my duty, it becomes necessary for
me on this occasion to mention to your Excellency the
affair of our three prizes, which, having during the war
entered Bergen as a neutral and friendly port, where they
might repair the damages they had suffered, and procure
provisions, were, by an order of your predecessor in the
office you so honorably fill, violently seized and delivered
to our enemies. I am inclined to think it was a hasty act,
procured by the importunities and misrepresentations of the
British Minister, and that your government could not, on
reflection, approve of it. But the injury was done, and I
flatter myself your Excellency will think with me, that it
ought to be repaired. The means and manner I beg
leave to recommend to your consideration, and am, with
great respect, Sir, &amp;c.</p>

<h3>TO ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">
Passy, April 16th, 1783.</p>
<p class="letter_open">Sir,
</p>

<p>You complain sometimes of not hearing from us. It is
now near three months since any of us have heard from
America. I think our last letters came with General de
Rochambeau. There is now a project under consideration
for establishing monthly packet boats between France
and New York, which I hope will be carried into execution;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
our correspondence then may be more regular and
frequent.</p>

<p>I send herewith another copy of the treaty concluded
with Sweden. I hope, however, that you will have received
the former, and that the ratification is forwarded.
The King, as the Ambassador informs me, is now employed
in examining the duties payable in his ports, with a view of
lowering them in favor of America, and thereby encouraging
and facilitating our mutual commerce.</p>

<p>M. de Walterstorff, Chamberlain of the King of Denmark,
formerly Chief Justice of the Danish West India
Islands, was last year at Paris, where I had some acquaintance
with him, and he is now returned hither. The newspapers
have mentioned him as intended to be sent Minister
from his Court to Congress, but he tells me no such
appointment has yet been made. He assures me, however,
that the King has a strong desire to have a treaty of
friendship and commerce with the United States, and he
has communicated to me a letter, which he received from
M. Rosencrone, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, expressing
that disposition. I enclose a copy of the letter, and if
Congress shall approve of entering into such a treaty with
the King of Denmark, of which I told M. de Walterstorff I
made no doubt, they will send to me, or whom else they shall
think proper, the necessary instructions and powers for that
purpose. In the meantime, to keep the business in train, I
have sent to that Minister for his consideration, a translation
of the plan, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mutatis mutandis</i>, which I received from
Congress for a treaty with Sweden, accompanied by a letter,
of which likewise I enclose a copy. I think it would
be well to make it one of the instructions to whoever is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
commissioned for the treaty, that he previously procure
satisfaction for the prizes mentioned in my letter.</p>

<p>The definitive treaties have met with great delays, partly
by the tardiness of the Dutch, but principally from the distractions
in the Court of England, where for six or seven
weeks there was properly no Ministry, nor any business
effected. They have at last settled a Ministry, but of such
a composition as does not promise to be lasting. The
papers will inform you who they are. It is now said,
that Mr Oswald, who signed the preliminaries, is not to
return here, but that Mr David Hartley comes in his
stead to settle the definitive. A Congress is also talked of,
and that some use is to be made therein of the mediation
formerly proposed of the Imperial Courts. Mr Hartley
is an old friend of mine, and a strong lover of peace, so that
I hope we shall not have much difficult discussion with
him; but I could have been content to have finished with
Mr Oswald, whom we always found very reasonable.</p>

<p>Mr Laurens, having left Bath, mended in his health, is
daily expected at Paris, where Messieurs Jay and Adams
still continue. Mr Jefferson has not yet arrived, nor the
Romulus, in which ship I am told he was to have taken his
passage. I have been the more impatient of this delay,
from the expectation given me of full letters by him. It is
extraordinary, that we should be so long without any arrivals
from America in any part of Europe. We have as
yet heard nothing of the reception of the preliminary articles
in America, though it is now nearly five months since
they were signed. Barney, indeed, did not get away from
hence before the middle of January, but copies went by
other ships long before him; he waited some time for the
money he carried, and afterwards was detained by violent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
contrary winds. He had a passport from England, and I
hope arrived safe; though we have been in some pain
for him, on account of a storm soon after he sailed.</p>

<p>The English merchants have shown great eagerness to
reassume their commerce with America, but apprehending
that our laws prohibiting that commerce, would not be
repealed till England had set the example by repealing
theirs, a number of vessels they had loaded with goods,
have been detained in port, while the Parliament have been
debating on the repealing bill, which has been altered two
or three times, and is not agreed upon yet. It was at first
proposed to give us equal privileges in trade with their
own subjects, repealing thereby with respect to us, so much
of their navigation act, as regards foreign nations. But
that plan seems to be laid aside, and what will finally be
done in the affair is uncertain. There is not a port in
France, and few in Europe, from which I have not received
several applications of persons desiring to be appointed
consuls for America. They generally offer to execute
the office for the honor of it, without salary. I suppose
the Congress will wait to see what course commerce will
take, and in what places it will fix itself, in order to find
where consuls will be necessary, before any appointments
are made, and perhaps it will then be thought best to send
some of our own people. If they are not allowed to trade,
there must be a great expense for salaries. If they may
trade, and are Americans, the fortunes they make will
mostly settle in our own country at last. The agreement
I was to make here respecting consuls, has not yet been
concluded. The article of trading is important. I think
it would be well to reconsider it.</p>

<p>I have caused to be struck here the medal, which I formerly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
mentioned to you, the design of which you seemed
to approve. I enclose one of them in silver, for the President
of Congress, and one in copper for yourself; the impression
on copper is thought to appear best, and you will
soon receive a number for the members. I have presented
one to the King, and another to the Queen, both in
gold, and one in silver to each of the Ministers, as a monumental
acknowledgment, which may go down to future
ages, of the obligations we are under to this nation. It is
mighty well received, and gives general pleasure. If the
Congress approve of it, as I hope they will, I may add
something on the die (for those to be struck hereafter) to
show that it was done by their order, which I could not
venture to do till I had authority for it.</p>

<p>A multitude of people are continually applying to me
personally, and by letters, for information respecting the
means of transporting themselves, families, and fortunes to
America. I give no encouragement to any of the King's
subjects, as I think it would not be right in me to do it,
without their sovereign's approbation; and, indeed, few
offer from France but persons of irregular conduct and
desperate circumstances, whom we had better be without;
but I think there will be great emigrations from England,
Ireland, and Germany. There is a great contest among
the ports, which of them shall be of those to be declared
<em>free</em> for the <em>American trade</em>. Many applications are made
to me to interest myself in the behalf of all of them, but
having no instructions on that head, and thinking it a matter
more properly belonging to the consul, I have done
nothing in it.</p>

<p>I have continued to send you the English papers. You
will often see falsehoods in them respecting what I say and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
do, &amp;c. You know those papers too well to make any
contradiction of such stuff necessary from me.</p>

<p>Mr Barclay is often ill, and I am afraid the settlement
of our accounts will be, in his hands, a long operation. I
shall be impatient at being detained here on that score,
after the arrival of my successor. Would it not be well to
join Mr Ridley with Mr Barclay for that service? He
resides in Paris, and seems active in business. I know
not indeed whether he would undertake it, but wish he
may.</p>

<p>The finances here are embarrassed, and a new loan is
proposed by way of lottery, in which it is said by some
calculators, the King will pay at the rate of seven per cent.
I mention this to furnish you with a fresh convincing proof
against cavillers of the King's generosity towards us, in
lending us six millions this year at five per cent, and of his
concern for our credit, in saving by that sum the honor of
Mr Morris's bills, while those drawn by his own officers
abroad have their payment suspended for a year after they
become due. You have been told that France might help
us more liberally if she would. This last transaction is a
demonstration of the contrary.</p>

<p>Please to show these last paragraphs to Mr Morris, to
whom I cannot now write, the notice of this ship being
short, but it is less necessary, as Mr Grand writes him
fully.</p>

<p>I send you enclosed the copies you desired of the papers
I read to you yesterday.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> I should be happy if I could
see, before I die, the proposed improvement of the law of
nations established. The miseries of mankind would be
diminished by it, and the happiness of millions secured and
promoted. If the practice of privateering could be profitable
to any civilized nation, it might be so to us Americans,
since we are so situated on the globe, as that the
rich commerce of Europe with the West Indies, consisting
of manufactures, sugars, &amp;c. is obliged to pass before our
doors, which enables us to make short and cheap cruises,
while our own commerce is in such bulky, low priced articles
as that ten of our ships taken by you are not equal in
value to one of yours, and you must come far from home
at a great expense to look for them. I hope therefore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
that this proposition, if made by us, will appear in its true
light, as having humanity only for its motive. I do not
wish to see a new Barbary rising in America, and our long
extended coast occupied by piratical States. I fear lest
our privateering success in the two last wars, should already
have given our people too strong a relish for that most mischievous
kind of gaming, mixed blood; and if a stop is
not now put to the practice, mankind may hereafter be
more plagued with American corsairs, than they have been
and are with the Turkish. Try, my friend, what you can
do, in procuring for your nation the glory of being, though
the greatest naval power, the first who voluntarily relinquished
the advantage that power seems to give them, of
plundering others, and thereby impeding the mutual communications
among men of the gifts of God, and rendering
miserable multitudes of merchants and their families, artizans,
and cultivators of the earth, the most peaceable and
innocent part of the human species.</p>

<h3>ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON TO B. FRANKLIN.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">
Philadelphia, May 9th, 1783.</p>
<p class="letter_open">
Dear Sir,
</p>

<p>We have yet had no information from you subsequent
to the signature of preliminary articles by France, Spain,
and Great Britain; though we have seen a declaration for
the cessation of hostilities signed by you, Mr Adams, and
Mr Jay.</p>

<p>We grow every day more anxious for the definitive
treaty, since we have as yet discovered no inclination in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
the enemy to evacuate their ports; and in sending off the
slaves, they have directly infringed the provisional treaty,
though we on our part have paid the strictest regard to it.
This will be more fully explained by the enclosed copy of
a letter from General Washington, containing a relation of
what passed between him and General Carleton at a late
interview. Let me again entreat, that no doubt may be
left in the treaty relative to the time and manner of evacuating
their ports here. Without more precision and accuracy
in this than we find in the provisional articles, we shall soon
be involved in new disputes with Great Britain.</p>

<p>Our finances are still greatly embarrassed. You may in
part see our distress, and the means Congress are using to
relieve themselves, by the enclosed pamphlet, which I wish
you and your colleagues to read, but not to publish.</p>

<p>The enclosed resolution imposes a new task upon you.
I hope you will find no great difficulty in procuring the
small augmentation to the loan which it requires. Be assured
that it is extremely necessary to set us down in
peace.</p>

<p>None of the States, though frequently called upon, have
sent me the estimates of their losses by the ravages of the
British, except Connecticut and Rhode Island, and their
accounts are extremely imperfect. Such as they are I enclose
them. For my own part, I have no great expectation
that any compensation for these losses will be procured;
however, if possible it should be attempted. Commissioners
might be appointed to ascertain them here.</p>

<p>Great part of the prisoners are on their way to New
York, and the whole will be sent in a few days. They
will amount to about six thousand men.</p>

<p>Our ports begin to be crowded with vessels. There is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
reason to fear that a superabundance of foreign articles
will, in the end, produce as much distress as the want of
them has heretofore occasioned.</p>

<p>I informed you sometime since, that I had written to the
Court of Appeals on the subject of the Nossa Senhora da
Soledado San Miguel e Almas, and laid before them the
papers you sent me. The cause has since been determined
in such a way as will, I hope, be satisfactory to her Portuguese
Majesty. I enclose the copy of a letter from the
first Judge of the Court of Appeals on that subject.</p>

<p>Nothing has yet been done as to the acceptance of your
resignation, nor will, as I believe, anything be done very
hastily. Many think your task will not be very burdensome
now, and that you may enjoy in peace the fruit of
your past labors.</p>

beg leave to remind you of the affairs of the Alliance and
the Bon Homme Richard, which are still unsettled. I
must also pray you not to lose sight of the vessels detained
by his Danish Majesty. This will be a favorable opportunity
to press for their restitution. I do not see how they
can decently refuse to pay for them. Great Britain is
bound in honor to make them whole again.</p>

very slowly, while the distress of our finances has compelled

Sir,
</p>

<p>I wrote to you fully by a vessel from Nantes, which I
hope will reach you before this. If not, this may inform
you that the ratification of the treaty with Sweden is come,
and ready to be exchanged when I shall receive that from
Congress; that the treaty with Denmark is going on,
and will probably, be ready before the commission for signing
it arrives from Congress. It is on the plan of that proposed
by Congress for Sweden.</p>

<p>Portugal has likewise proposed to treat with us, and the
Ambassador has earnestly urged me to give him a plan for
the consideration of his Court, which I have accordingly
done, and he has forwarded it. The Congress will send
commissions and instructions for concluding these treaties
to whom they may think proper; it is only upon the old
authority, given, by a resolution, to myself with Messrs
Deane and Lee, to treat with any European powers, that I
have ventured to begin these treaties in consequence of
overtures from those Crowns.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>The definitive treaty with England is not yet concluded,
their Ministry being unsettled in their minds as to the
terms of the commercial part; nor is any other definitive
treaty yet completed here, nor even the preliminaries signed
of one between England and Holland. It is now five
months since we have had a line from you, the last being
dated the 13th of January; of course we know nothing
of the reception of the preliminary articles, or the opinion
of Congress respecting them. We hoped to receive before
this time such instructions as might have been thought
proper to be sent to us for rendering more perfect the definitive
treaty. We know nothing of what has been approved
or disapproved. We are totally in the dark, and
therefore, less pressing to conclude, being still (as we have
long been) in daily expectation of hearing from you. By
chance only, we learn that Barney is arrived, by whom
went the despatches of the Commissioners, and a considerable
sum of money. No acknowledgment of the receipt
of that money is yet come to hand, either to me or
M. Gerard. I make no doubt that both you and Mr

<p>Captain Barney arrived here last Wednesday, and
brought despatches for us as late as the first of June. The
preliminary articles are ratified. But General Carleton,
in violation of those articles, has sent away a great number
of negroes, alleging, that freedom having been promised
them by a proclamation, the honor of the nation was concerned,

had been restored to their masters, Britain could not have
hoped anything from such another proclamation hereafter.</p>

a letter from Mr Fox, assuring him that our suspicions
of affected delays or change of system on their side<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>

<p>It was with the greatest alacrity, that I laid before his

also the project of a treaty of amity and commerce that accompanied

the assurances contained in that letter, of the good
disposition of Congress to form connexions of amity and
commerce with his kingdoms, such connexions being
equally conformable to the interests of the two States, and
to his Majesty's sincere desire to cement, by every possible
means, that harmony, union, and confidence, which he

adding some articles, and only giving a different turn to
others, so that I flatter myself, that I shall soon hear that
you are perfectly satisfied with them, having observed the
most perfect reciprocity carefully established throughout.</p>

<p>As to the object mentioned in the letter with which you
have honored me, you already know, Sir, his Majesty's
generous intentions towards the individuals in question, and
his Majesty is the more induced to avail himself of the first
opportunity to manifest these intentions, as he thinks he may
reasonably hope that Congress will also consider them as
a distinguished proof of his friendship and esteem for that
respectable body.</p>

<p>There remains nothing further for me to add, but that
the King will adopt with great pleasure the most proper
means to accelerate the conclusion of the treaty, which we
have begun. For myself, it will be the most agreeable
part of my office, Sir, to assist in perfecting such happy
connexions with a minister of such universal reputation

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>His Majesty, the King of Denmark and Norway, and the
United States of America, wishing to fix in an equitable
and permanent manner the regulations necessary in the
commerce, which they are desirous to establish between
their respective countries, conceive that they cannot accomplish
this object better, than by taking as the basis for their
conventions, the most perfect equality and reciprocity,
leaving to each party the liberty of making such interior
regulations, with respect to commerce and navigation, as
shall appear suitable, and founding the advantages of commerce
on reciprocal utility, and the just laws of free competition.
It is in consequence of these principles, and of
mature deliberation, that the contracting parties have
agreed upon the following articles.</p>


<h4>ARTICLE I.</h4>

<p>There shall be a firm, inviolable, and universal peace,
and a true and sincere friendship, between his Majesty, the
King of Denmark and Norway, his heirs and successors,
on the one part, and the United States of America on the
other, and between the citizens and subjects of the said
powers, and likewise between the countries, islands, cities,
and places situated within their respective jurisdictions, and
the people and inhabitants thereof, of whatever rank or
condition they may be, without exception of persons or
places.</p>


<h4>ARTICLE II.</h4>

<p>The subjects of his Majesty, the King of Denmark and
Norway, may frequent the countries and latitudes of the
United States, reside and traffic there in all kinds of merchandise
and effects, the importation or exportation whereof
is not, or shall not be prohibited, and in all places where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
the navigation or commerce are not, or shall not be reserved
solely for the citizens and inhabitants of the United
States; and they shall not pay in the ports, harbors, roads,
countries, islands, cities, and places of the United States,
other or greater duties or imposts of any kind or denomination
whatever, than such as the most favored nations pay,
or shall pay. They shall, moreover, enjoy all the rights,
liberties, privileges, and exemptions, with respect to trade,
navigation, and commerce, which the most favored nations
do or shall enjoy, and they shall also conform to the laws and
ordinances, which the said nations are, or shall be bound to
observe, whether in passing from one port to another of
the dominions of the said States, or in returning from any
part, or to any part of the world whatever.</p>


<h4>ARTICLE III.</h4>

<p>In like manner, the citizens and inhabitants of the
United States of America may frequent the States of his
Majesty, the King of Denmark and Norway, reside and
traffic there in all kinds of merchandise and effects, the
importation or exportation whereof is not, or shall not be
prohibited, and in all places where the navigation and
commerce are not, or shall not be reserved solely to his
Danish Majesty's subjects, and they shall not pay in the
ports, harbors, roads, countries, islands, cities, and places
belonging to his said Majesty, other or greater duties and
imposts of any kind or denomination whatever, than such
as the most favored nations do, or shall pay. They shall,
moreover, enjoy all the rights, liberties, privileges, and exemptions,
which the most favored nations do, or shall
enjoy, and they shall also conform to the laws and ordinances
which the said nations are, or shall be bound to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>

States of America, with their subjects and inhabitants, shall
allow his Danish Majesty's subjects peaceably to enjoy their
rights in the countries, islands, establishments, and seas, in
the East and West Indies, without molestation or opposition.</p>


<h4>ARTICLE IV.</h4>

<p>His Majesty, the King of Denmark and Norway, shall
use every means in his power to protect and defend all the
vessels and effects belonging to the citizens or inhabitants
of the said United States of America, as shall be in his
ports, harbors, or roads, or in the vicinity of his territories,
countries, islands, cities, and places, as far as his jurisdiction
extends, as to the sea, and shall use his efforts to recover
and cause to be restored to the lawful proprietors, the
vessels and effects which shall be taken from them within
the extent of his said jurisdiction, and his ships of war, or
any other convoys whatever, sailing under his authority,
shall, on all occasions where there may be a common enemy,
take under their protection all the vessels belonging to
the citizens or inhabitants of the United States, or any of
them which may be holding the same course, or going the
same route, and they shall defend the said ships as long as
they shall hold the same course, or follow the same route,
against every attack, force, or violence of the common
enemy, in the same manner as they are bound to defend
and protect the vessels belonging to his said Majesty's
subjects.</p>


<h4>ARTICLE V.</h4>

<p>In like manner, the said United States and their ships
of war, sailing under their authority, shall protect and defend,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
in conformity with the preceding article, all the
vessels and effects belonging to the subjects of his Danish
Majesty, and shall use all their efforts to recover and cause
to be restored the said vessels and effects, which shall
have been taken within the extent of the jurisdiction of the
said States, and each of them.</p>


<h4>ARTICLE VI.</h4>

<p>It is agreed and determined that every merchant, captains
of merchant vessels, or others, his Danish Majesty's subjects,
shall have entire liberty in all places within the dominions
and jurisdiction of the United States of America, to manage
themselves, their own affairs, and to employ whomsoever
they please to manage them, and they shall not be obliged
to make use of any interpreter or broker, nor to pay them
any fee, unless they make use of them; and with respect
to the time and manner of loading or unloading their ships
and whatever belongs to them, they shall always be considered
and treated as the most favored nations, and shall
pay no fee or salary, which the said nations are not bound
to pay in similar cases. The citizens, inhabitants, and
subjects of the United States of America shall reciprocally
have and enjoy the same privileges and liberties in all the
places belonging to his Majesty, the King of Denmark
and Norway.</p>


<h4>ARTICLE VII.</h4>

<p>Whenever one of the contracting parties shall be at war
with other powers, the communication and free commerce
of the subjects of the other party with the States of the
said powers, shall not on that account be interrupted.
On the contrary, in this case it is agreed and stipulated,
that every ship and vessel of the neutral party may freely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
navigate from port to port, and on the coasts of the States
at enmity with the other party, and that the vessels and
ships being free, shall likewise secure the liberty of merchandise;
so that everything shall be judged free which
shall be found on board of the vessels belonging to the
subjects of one of the contracting parties, although the
loading, or part of it, should belong to the enemies of one
of them; it being, nevertheless, well understood, that contraband
goods shall be always excepted; and it is also
agreed, that this same liberty shall extend to the persons
of such as shall be found on board of the free vessel, even
though they should be enemies of one of the two contracting
parties, and they shall not be taken from on board the
said vessels, unless they are military characters, and actually
in the service of the enemy.</p>


<h4>ARTICLE VIII.</h4>

<p>The merchant vessels of one of the two contracting
parties, coming either from a port belonging to the enemy,
or from their own, or a neutral port, and navigating
towards a port of an enemy of the other, shall be bound
every time they shall be required, to exhibit, as well on
the high seas as in port, their passports, or sea letters, and
other public documents, which shall expressly prove that
their loading is not of that kind, which is prohibited as contraband;
it being well understood, nevertheless, that in all
cases, where such merchant vessels shall be escorted by
one or more vessels of war, the simple declaration of the
officer commanding the convoy, that these vessels do not
carry any contraband goods, shall be considered as fully
sufficient, and they shall not require to examine the papers
of the escorted vessels.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<h4>ARTICLE IX.</h4>

<p>It shall no sooner be found by the sea letters, passports,
or other public documents, or by the verbal declaration of
the commanding officer of the convoy, that the merchant
vessels are not laden with contraband goods, than they
shall be at liberty to continue their voyage without any
hinderance; but if, on the contrary, the exhibition of the
said passports or other documents, in case the vessels are
not escorted, tends to discover that the said vessels carry
merchandise reputed contraband, consigned to an enemy's
port, it shall not, however, be permitted to break open the
hatches of the said vessels, nor to open any chest, case,
trunk, bale, package, or cask, which shall be found on
board, or to displace or overturn the least part of the merchandise,
whether the vessel belongs to his Danish Majesty's
subjects, or to the citizens or inhabitants of the United
States, until the cargo has been landed in presence of the
officers of the Courts of Admiralty, and that the inventory
has been made of it. And it shall not be permitted to
sell, exchange, or alienate the merchandise reputed contraband,
in any manner whatever, before trial has been
held and legally finished, to declare them contraband, and
that the Courts of Admiralty shall have pronounced them
confiscated, without any prejudice, nevertheless, to the vessels
or to the merchandise, which by virtue of the treaty
shall be considered free. It shall not be permitted to retain
these merchandises under pretence, that they have been
intermixed with the contraband merchandise, and still less
confiscate them as legal prizes. In case where a part
only, and not the whole of the loading, shall consist of contraband
merchandises, and that the commander of the vessel
consents to deliver them up to the privateer, which shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
have discovered them, then the captain, who shall have
made the prize, after having received the merchandise,
must immediately release the vessel, and shall not in any
wise prevent the continuation of his voyage; but in case
the contraband merchandise cannot all be taken on board
the captor, then the captain of the said vessel shall be at
liberty, notwithstanding the offer to deliver the contraband
goods, to conduct the master to the nearest port, in conformity
to what is prescribed above.</p>


<h4>ARTICLE X.</h4>

<p>In order to obviate entirely every disorder and violence,
it is stipulated, that whenever the merchant vessels and
ships of the subjects and inhabitants of one of the two parties,
navigating alone, shall be met by any vessel of war,
privateer, or armed vessel of the other party, the said vessels
of war, privateers, or armed vessels, shall remain on
their part constantly out of cannonshot, and shall not send
above two or three men in their boats on board the merchant
vessels or ships, to examine the passports or other
documents, which shall prove the property and cargoes of
the said vessels or ships. Such of the vessels of war,
privateers, or armed vessels of the one party, as shall
molest or damage in any manner whatever the ships or
vessels of the other, shall be obliged to answer for it in
their persons and property, and consequently, to render
satisfaction for all damage and interest over and above the
reparation due for the insult shown the flag.</p>


<h4>ARTICLE XI.</h4>

<p>It is agreed that everything that is found laden by the
respective subjects or inhabitants on board of vessels belonging
to the enemies of the other party, or to their subjects,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
shall be confiscated without distinction of prohibited
merchandise, in like manner as though it belonged to
the enemy, excepting always such effects and merchandise
as shall have been put on board of said vessels, before
the declaration of war, or even after said declaration, if, at
the time of lading, it was unknown, so that the merchandises
of the subjects of the two contracting parties, whether
they are of the number termed contraband or otherwise,
which, as has just been said, shall have been laden on
board of a vessel belonging to the enemy before the war,
or even after the declaration, when it was not known, shall
in no wise be subject to confiscation, but shall be faithfully
and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">bona fide</i> returned without delay to their proprietors
who shall claim them, it being well understood, nevertheless,
that it shall not be permitted to carry into the enemy's
ports merchandise of a contraband nature. And in order
that every dissension may be avoided, it is agreed, that
after the term of six months being elapsed from the declaration
of war, the respective subjects, from whatever part
of the world they may come, shall not allege the ignorance
mentioned in the present article.</p>


<h4>ARTICLE XII.</h4>

<p>All vessels and merchandise of whatever nature soever,
whenever they shall have been recovered from the hands
of pirates on the high seas, shall be brought into some port
of one of the two States, and shall be delivered to the care
of the officers of the said port, in order to be restored entire
to their true proprietor, as soon as he shall have duly
and sufficiently proved his property.</p>


<h4>ARTICLE XIII.</h4>

<p>The ships of war belonging to the two parties, as also
those of their subjects which are armed, shall conduct at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
full liberty wheresoever they please, the prizes they shall
have made from their enemies, without being obliged to pay
any other duties than such as the most favored nations;
the said vessels or the said prizes, on entering into the ports
of his Danish Majesty, or of the said United States, shall
not be subject to be stopped or seized, nor shall the officers
of the places have any power to take cognizance of the validity
of the said prizes, which shall go out, and be freely
conducted in full liberty, to the places mentioned in the
commissions, which the captains of the said vessels shall be
obliged to produce.</p>


<h4>ARTICLE XIV.</h4>

<p>In order to favor as much as possible the commerce on
both sides, it is agreed, that if a war should happen between
his Majesty, the King of Denmark and Norway, and the
United States of America, (which God forbid) nine months
after the declaration of war shall be granted to the subjects
on both sides to collect, sell, and transport freely, the merchandise
and effects belonging to them, and to withdraw
themselves; and if anything is taken from them, or if any
injury is done to them during the above prescribed time, by
one of the two parties, full and entire satisfaction shall be
given them in this respect.</p>


<h4>ARTICLE XV.</h4>

<p>No subject of his Majesty, the King of Denmark and
Norway, shall take a commission or letter of marque (to arm
any vessel or vessels, for the purpose of acting as a privateer
against the said United States, or any of them, or
against their subjects, people, or inhabitants, or against
their property, or that of any among them) from any Prince
whatever, with whom the said United States shall be at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
war. In like manner no citizen, subject, or inhabitant of
the said United States, or of any of them, shall demand or
accept of any commission or letter of marque (to arm any
vessel or vessels, to cruise against the subjects of his said
Majesty, or any of them, or their property) from any Prince
or State whatever, with whom his Majesty shall be at war;
and if any one of either nation should take such commissions
or letter of marque, he shall be punished as a pirate.</p>


<h4>ARTICLE XVI.</h4>

<p>In case the vessels of the subjects and inhabitants of one
of the two contracting parties should approach the coasts of
the other, without however designing to enter into the port,
or to discharge the cargo, or to break bulk after having
entered, they shall be at liberty to depart, or to pursue
their voyage without molestation, in the same manner as
is practiced by the vessels belonging to the most favored
nations.</p>


<h4>ARTICLE XVII.</h4>

<p>The liberty of navigation and commerce, mentioned in
the 7th article of this treaty, shall extend to all kinds of
merchandises, excepting those which are designated by the
name of contraband. Under this name of contraband, or
prohibited merchandise, are only to be comprehended,
arms, cannon, powder, matches, pikes, swords, lances,
spears, halberts, mortars, petards, grenades, saltpetre,
fusils, balls, bucklers, helmets, drums, coats of mail, and
other arms of that kind fit to arm soldiers, swivels, shoulder
belts, horses with their equipages, and all other instruments
of war whatever, excepting always the quantity
that may be necessary for the defence of the vessel and
such as compose the crew. All other effects and merchandise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
not expressly designated above, of whatever kind
or denomination they may be, and however fit they may
be, even for the building, the repairing, and equipment of
vessels, or for the making of any machine or warlike instrument
by land or by sea, shall not be considered as
contraband, and they may consequently be transported and
conducted in the freest manner by the subjects of the two
contracting parties to places belonging to the enemy, excepting,
nevertheless, such as shall be actually besieged,
blocked up or invested, and such shall only be considered
so, where the vessels of the power that attacks shall be so
near, and posted in such a manner, as that there shall be
evident danger to enter.</p>


<h4>ARTICLE XVIII.</h4>

<p>The passports or sea letters, which shall prove the
property of the neutral vessels, according to the tenor of
the 8th Article of the present treaty, shall be prepared
and distributed according to the model which shall be
agreed on. Every time that the vessel shall have returned
to its own country, it shall be furnished with new
passports of the like kind; at least, these passports must
not be of an older date than two years after the time the
vessel has returned last to its own country. Moreover,
the vessels being loaded, must be provided with such certificates,
or manifests, or other public documents, as are
commonly given to vessels which depart from the ports
from whence they have last sailed, containing a specification
of the cargo, of the place from whence the vessel has
departed, and that of her destination, in order that it may
be known whether there are any contraband effects on
board of the vessels, and whether they are destined to
carry them to an enemy's country, or not. If the names<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
of the persons to whom the effects on board belong, are
not expressed in the said documents, this omission shall
not, however, give cause for confiscation, as the freedom
of the vessel secures the freedom of the effects.</p>


<h4>ARTICLE XIX.</h4>

<p>Should it happen that the ships or vessels of one of the
two contracting parties, or of their subjects, should strike
against the rocks, or strand, or be shipwrecked on the
coast of the other, the respective subjects shall enjoy both
for their persons and their ships and vessels, effects and
merchandise, all the aid and assistance possible, as the
inhabitants of the country, and shall only pay the same expenses
and duties, which the proper subjects of the State
on whose coasts they shall have stranded or have been
shipwrecked, are subject to in similar cases.</p>


<h4>ARTICLE XX.</h4>

<p>If the subjects or inhabitants of one of the two parties,
compelled by storm, or by the pursuit of pirates, or of the
enemy, or by any other accident, find themselves constrained
to take refuge with their ships in the rivers, bays,
ports, and roads belonging to the other, they shall be received
and treated with every humanity and kindness, and
they shall be permitted likewise to refresh and to furnish
themselves at a just price with every kind of provisions,
and everything necessary for the maintenance and support
of their persons, and for the reparation of their ships, provided
they carry on no commerce contrary to the laws and
ordinances of the place or port into which they have
entered.</p>


<h4>ARTICLE XXI.</h4>

<p>It is agreed, that the subjects of each of the contracting
parties, and their ships, vessels, merchandise, and effects,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
shall not be subject to an embargo or detention in any of
the countries, islands, towns, places, ports, or domains
whatever of the other party, for any military expedition,
public or private use, in any manner whatever, and in
cases of seizure, detentions, or arrests for debts contracted,
or faults committed by any subject of one of the parties in
the States of the other, the said seizures, detentions, or
arrests shall be made only by order and authority of the
justice, and according to the ordinary means; and with
regard to debts and faults, process ought to be made by
way of equity, and agreeably to the forms of the justice of
the place.</p>


<h4>ARTICLE XXII.</h4>

<p>The two contracting parties have mutually granted permission
to have in their respective ports, consuls, vice consuls,
agents, and commissaries, which they shall appoint
themselves, and whose functions shall be regulated by a
particular convention whenever either of the parties wish
to establish it.</p>


<h4>ARTICLE XXIII.</h4>

<p>The subjects of his Majesty, the King of Denmark and
Norway, may in the country of the United States of America
dispose of their effects by testament, donation, or otherwise;
and their heirs, subjects of his said Majesty, shall
succeed them, without any impediment in all their effects,
moveable and immoveable, either by testament or ab intestat;
so that they may take possession of the inheritance,
either by themselves, or by attorney, and dispose of it
as they please, after having discharged the different duties
established by the laws of the State where the said succession
shall have been left; and in case that the heirs of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
said dead subjects should be absent or minors, and that the
deceased shall not have appointed guardians or executors,
the property left shall then be inventoried by the Notary
Public, or by the magistrate of the place, and disposed of
in such manner that they may be kept and preserved for the
legal proprietors; and, supposing that there should arise a
dispute about such inheritance among several pretenders,
then the Judges of the places where the effects of the deceased
shall be found, shall decide the process by a definitive
sentence agreeably to the laws of the country. The
contents of the present article shall be reciprocally observed,
with respect to the subjects of the United States of
America, in the States of his Danish Majesty.</p>


<h4>ARTICLE XXIV.</h4>

<p>A perfect liberty of conscience shall be granted to the
subjects and inhabitants of each party within the respective
States, and they may, consequently, freely attend the worship
of their religion without being disturbed or molested,
provided that they submit, as to the public demonstration,
to the ordinances and laws of the country.</p>


<h4>ARTICLE XXV.</h4>

<p>His Majesty, the King of Denmark and Norway, and
the United States of North America, have agreed, that the
present treaty shall be in full effect during the space of
fifteen successive years, reckoning from the day of its ratification;
and the two contracting parties reserve to themselves
the power of renewing it at the expiration of that time.</p>


<h4>ARTICLE XXVI.</h4>

<p>The present treaty shall be ratified on both sides, and
the ratifications shall be exchanged within the space of
eight months from the date of the signature.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<h3>EXPLANATION OF THE COUNTER PROJECT</h3>

<p class="center"><em>Of a Treaty of Amity and Commerce received from Denmark.</em></p>

<h4>Translation.</h4>

<p>Although the simple comparison of the enclosed Counter
Project, with the Project proposed by Mr Franklin,
evidently proves the attention that has been shown on our
part here to the negotiation set on foot, and which, in the
main, has been agreed upon as to the principles, which
have been adopted for the basis of a treaty, as well as the
most essential stipulations, we could not avoid, however,
explaining more distinctly certain points of the Counter
Project; and the eclaircissements that will be given of
them will at the same time prove the amicable intentions,
with which it has been endeavored to facilitate the consequences
of an affair too important to the welfare of the
two nations, not to merit the attention and cares of the
powers which govern them.</p>

<p>The second and third articles will regulate the conduct
of the reciprocal subjects in the respective States. Taking
things as they now are, it is easily perceived that the stipulations
of the said articles, although apparently reciprocal,
give however superior advantages to the United States.
For, according to the system of commerce, which subsists
in Denmark and Norway, the most favored nations pay
there no greater imposts or other duties than the proper
subjects of the State, and the proper subjects of the State
enjoy considerable diminutions with respect to unprivileged
nations, as well for their vessels as their merchandise.
It is evident, therefore, that the subjects of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
United States of America being received among the most
favored nations in Denmark and Norway, would not only
gain by that means a competition with the said most
favored, but also a preference over several other nations,
even in the neighborhood of Denmark, with whom no treaties
of commerce have been concluded, and who, therefore,
are still in the number of unprivileged, as to navigation
and commerce, in the States of his Danish Majesty.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if the advantages, which would result
from these articles, as to the commerce of the subjects of
Denmark in the territories of the United States, are considered,
the said advantages would be confined to the simple
competition with every other foreign nation; but, as
there is no nation that we know of, which actually pays in
the territories of the United States other or greater duties,
than what the privileged or most favored nations are bound
to pay, the Danish subjects would not find in the territories
of the United States the same preference, which the subjects
of the United States would obtain in Denmark and
Norway. The preceding considerations are not advanced
for the purpose of taking any advantage, but they are
pointed out only to show the impartiality and good will, with
which we desire to contribute to the mutual connexions
of amity and commerce between the two nations, who will,
it is to be hoped, more and more unite. As to the periods
inserted in these articles, they do not essentially change
the stipulations projected by the Minister of the United
States; they only add therein some proper determination
to prevent every misunderstanding on the subject of the
reciprocal liberties and privileges, and to guaranty some
rights, which the subjects of his Danish Majesty enjoy with
respect to certain countries and colonies, as Iceland, Greenland,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
Finmarson, Faro, the establishment of Tranquibar,
and, in certain respects, the Islands of St Croix, St Thomas,
and St John; and if, at any time, it should please the United
States to reserve for its own subjects similar rights, with
respect to certain places, or certain kinds of merchandise,
and to exclude therefrom every foreign nation, the same
stipulations shall then suit their intentions. In like manner
the same mark of reciprocity has been given to every
change, excepting only the last clause of the third article,
which has not been susceptible of the same turn, considering
the local position of the United States, and which, undoubtedly
for the same reason, has been inserted in the
treaty of the United States with Holland, in the same manner
as it is here in the Counter Project.</p>

<p>After having pointed out the privileges, which the subjects
of his Danish Majesty enjoy in the islands of St Croix,
St Thomas, and St John, it will not be useless to observe,
that it is only the commerce and navigation between the
said islands and Europe, which Denmark has appropriated
to itself in any manner; but the commerce, which is conducted
between those islands and North America, although
always subject to the same interior regulations on both
sides, has been for a long while authorised by his Danish
Majesty's commercial laws, and his said Majesty has,
moreover, granted to the islands of St Thomas and St John
privileges, which will give the commerce of these islands,
with America in particular, a freer course, and very different
from that of the commerce of the colony. The advantages,
which the United States may derive from a more
close commercial connexion with the said privileged islands,
and whose ports, distinguished by the security they
insure to vessels, appear to invite the commercial subjects<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
of America, are too evident to need any circumstantial
detail. There shall only be added, therefore, to what has
been said, this single observation, that his Danish Majesty,
having it very much at heart to open every possible road
to industry and commerce, finds himself much disposed to
favor the connexion in question, and that, if for this purpose
the United States, after the conclusion of the present
treaty, which shall fix the general commercial points between
the contracting parties, should desire a particular
convention to agree upon the reciprocal and local advantages
proper to accomplish this object, his said Majesty
would willingly come into it, provided that the United
States were equally disposed on their part to facilitate the
affair.</p>

<p>The fourth and fifth articles have only been modified in
order to remove the doubts, which might arise with respect
to the defence and protection due to the vessels belonging
to the respective subjects. It is only in cases of attack
from the common enemy, against whom it was conceived
possible to confine each other by these articles; for in case
that one of the parties was at war and the other at peace,
the vessels belonging to the neutral party could not protect
the vessels belonging to the belligerent party, without taking
a part and quitting its neutrality.</p>

<p>The privileges of the most favored nations undoubtedly
guaranty to the respective subjects the favors mentioned
in the sixth, eleventh, fourteenth, and seventeenth articles of
the Project. For this reason it has appeared, that it would
be better to reduce the points detailed in these articles
to the number of general liberties of the most favored nations,
and this is what has been done in the sixth, thirteenth,
sixteenth, and twentyfirst articles of the Counter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
Project, contenting ourselves here with the assurance, that
the subjects of his Danish Majesty in the cases mentioned
here, as well as in any other, shall be regarded and treated
in the territories within the dominions of the United States
as the most favored nations, and in expectation that the
United States will not demand anything more in these respects.</p>

<p>The seventh, eighth, and ninth articles of the Counter
Project only contain the spirit and ideas of the fifteenth,
seventh, and eighth articles of the Project, to
which has been added some further stipulations, conformable
to the principles, which have been established and
acknowledged with respect to the commerce of neutral
nations in time of war.</p>

<p>The term of two months, which has been proposed in
the ninth article, and that of six months named in the
twelfth article of the Project, did not appear to correspond
with the extent of commerce, which is carried on, particularly
with the East Indies, nor with difficulties, which the
merchants or inhabitants sometimes find in arranging their
affairs to change their abode. It is for this reason, that
instead of two and six months, the terms six and nine
months have been substituted, it being nevertheless well
understood, that from the friendship and good understanding,
which is about being strengthened between the two
nations, the subjects of neither party will ever have cause
to take refuge on account of a rupture.</p>

<p>Although no fault has been found as to the merchandise,
which the Project has called contraband, or not contraband
in time of war, there is however reason to think, that it
would still be better for the conveniency of the contracting
parties, only to name in express terms the contraband,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
without detailing the free merchandise, with respect to
which no better explanation could be given, as it appears,
than by agreeing that everything that is not called contraband
shall be comprehended in the number of free merchandise;
consequently, on this principle, the seventeenth
article of the Counter Project has been arranged, and at the
end of the article has been added the definition of a port
that is blocked up.</p>

<p>The new articles that have been proposed on this side
principally turn on reciprocal points and favors, which justice
and equity demand, and which humanity and the
rights of nations ordinarily grant, even without stipulation
by express conventions; but it is usage that has introduced
them into treaties, and it is conceived that it is no less
necessary to conform thereto.</p>

<p>As to the passports mentioned in the eighteenth article
of the Counter Project, there is nothing easier than to agree
about them after the conclusion of the treaty, or at the
time when it is concluded, and the models that shall be
agreed on can then be officially exchanged and published
in case of necessity.</p>

Cadiz, July 15th, 1783.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,
</p>

<p>His Imperial Majesty, the Emperor of Morocco, did me
the honor to appoint me to be the bearer of his answer to
the United Provinces of North America, with which he is
willing to sign a treaty of peace and commerce, and in
consequence has already given orders to his Captains of
men of war not to molest on the open seas the American<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
vessels, which agreeable news I have already given to Mr
Richard Harrison. According to my instructions, I am to
accompany to the Court of Morocco the Ambassador, that
will be appointed to conclude the treaty of peace. I presume,
that your Excellency is already acquainted, that the
travelling expenses and other charges of ambassadors, or
envoys, sent to Europe by the Emperor of Morocco, are to
be paid by the Court, or Republic, that demands his
friendship. In a few days I intend to set out for Madrid,
where I will remain till I receive your Excellency's answer
to this letter, directed to William Carmichael, the United
States Charg√© d'Affaires at the Court of Spain, who, I
make no doubt, will receive orders to supply me with the
money I may want on the occasion.</p>

<p>As soon as I arrive at Paris I shall have the satisfaction
to entertain at large your Excellency on the present negotiation,
not doubting it will soon be concluded to the advantage
of both Courts.</p>

<p>
In the meantime I remain, most truly, Sir, &amp;c.</p>

<h3>TO ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">
Passy, July 22d, 1783.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,
</p>

<p>You have complained, sometimes with reason, of not
hearing from your Foreign Ministers; we have had cause
to make the same complaint, six full months having intervened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
between the latest date of your preceding letters and
the receipt of those by Captain Barney. During all this
time we were ignorant of the reception of the Provisional
Treaty, and the sentiments of Congress upon it, which, if we
had received sooner, might have forwarded the proceedings
on the Definitive Treaty, and, perhaps, brought them to a
conclusion, at a time more favorable than the present. But
these occasional interruptions of correspondence are the
inevitable consequences of a state of war, and of such remote
situations. Barney had a short passage, and arrived
some days before Colonel Ogden, who also brought despatches
from you, all of which are come safe to hand.
We, the Commissioners, have in our joint capacity written
a letter to you, which you will receive with this.</p>

<p>I shall now answer yours of March the 26th, May the
9th, and May the 31st.</p>

<p>It gave me great pleasure to learn by the first, that the
news of peace diffused general satisfaction. I will not
now take it upon me to justify the apparent reserve, respecting
this Court, at the signature, which you disapprove.
We have touched upon it in our general letter. I do not
see, however, that they have much reason to complain of
that transaction. Nothing was stipulated to their prejudice,
and none of the stipulations were to have force, but
by a subsequent act of their own. I suppose, indeed, that
they have not complained of it, or you would have sent us
a copy of the complaint, that we might have answered it.
I long since satisfied Count de Vergennes about it here.
We did what appeared to all of us best at the time, and if
we have done wrong, the Congress will do right, after hearing
us, to censure us. Their nomination of five persons to
the service seems to mark, that they had some dependence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
on our joint judgment, since one alone could have made
a treaty by direction of the French Ministry as well as
twenty.</p>

<p>I will only add, that with respect to myself, neither the
letter from M. Marbois, handed us through the British
negotiators, (a suspicious channel) nor the conversations
respecting the fishery, the boundaries, the royalists, &amp;c.
recommending moderation in our demands, are of weight
sufficient in my mind to fix an opinion, that this Court
wished to restrain us, in obtaining any degree of advantage
we could prevail on our enemies to accord, since those
discourses are fairly resolvable, by supposing a very natural
apprehension, that we, relying too much on the ability of
France to continue the war in our favor, and supply us
constantly with money, might insist on more advantages
than the English would be willing to grant, and thereby
lose the opportunity of making peace, so necessary to all
our friends.</p>

<p>I ought not, however, to conceal from you, that one of
my colleagues is of a very different opinion from me in
these matters. He thinks the French Minister one of the
greatest enemies of our country, that he would have
straitened our boundaries, to prevent the growth of our
people; contracted our fishery, to obstruct the increase of
our seamen; and retained the royalists among us, to keep
us divided; that he privately opposes all our negotiations
with foreign Courts, and afforded us, during the war, the
assistance we received only to keep it alive, that we might
be so much the more weakened by it; that to think of
gratitude to France is the greatest of follies, and that to be
influenced by it would ruin us. He makes no secret of
his having these opinions, expresses them publicly, sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
in presence of the English Ministers, and speaks of
hundreds of instances which he could produce in proof of
them. None, however, have yet appeared to me, unless
the conversations and letter abovementioned are reckoned
such.</p>

<p>If I were not convinced of the real inability of this
Court to furnish the further supplies we asked, I should
suspect these discourses of a person in his station might
have influenced the refusal, but I think they have gone no
further than to occasion a suspicion, that we have a considerable
party of antigallicans in America, who are not
tories, and consequently, to produce some doubts of the
continuance of our friendship. As such doubts may hereafter
have a bad effect, I think we cannot take too much
care to remove them; and it is, therefore, I write this to
put you on your guard, (believing it my duty, though I
know that I hazard by it a mortal enmity) and to caution
you respecting the insinuations of this gentleman against
this Court, and the instances he supposes of their ill will to
us, which I take to be as imaginary as I know his fancies
to be, that Count de Vergennes and myself are continually
plotting against him, and employing the newswriters of Europe
to depreciate his character, &amp;c. But as Shakspeare
says, "Trifles light as air," &amp;c. I am persuaded, however,
that he means well for his country, is always an honest
man, often a wise one, but sometimes, and in some things,
absolutely out of his senses.</p>

<p>When the commercial article, mentioned in yours of the
26th, was struck out of our proposed preliminaries by the
British Ministry, the reason given was, that sundry acts of
Parliament still in force were against it, and must be first
repealed, which I believe was really their intention, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
sundry bills were accordingly brought in for that purpose;
but new Ministers with different principles succeeding, a
commercial proclamation totally different from those bills
has lately appeared. I send enclosed a copy of it. We
shall try what can be done in the Definitive Treaty
towards setting aside that proclamation, but if it should be
persisted in, it will then be a matter worthy the attentive
discussion of Congress, whether it will be most prudent to
retort with a similar regulation in order to force its repeal,
(which may possibly tend to bring on another quarrel) or to
let it pass without notice, and leave it to its own inconvenience,
or rather impracticability in the execution, and to the
complaints of the West India planters, who must all pay
much dearer for our produce under those restrictions.</p>

<p>I am not enough master of the course of our commerce
to give an opinion on this particular question, and it does
not behove me to do it; yet I have seen so much embarrassment
and so little advantage in all the restraining and
compulsive systems, that I feel myself strongly inclined to
believe, that a State, which leaves all her ports open to all
the world upon equal terms, will, by that means, have
foreign commodities cheaper, sell its own productions
dearer, and be on the whole the most prosperous. I have
heard some merchants say, that there is ten per cent difference
between <em>Will you buy?</em> and <em>Will you sell?</em> When
foreigners bring us their goods, they want to part with
them speedily, that they may purchase their cargoes and
despatch their ships, which are at constant charges in our
ports; we have then the advantage of their <em>Will you buy?</em>
And when they demand our produce, we have the advantage
of their <em>Will you sell?</em> And the concurring demands
of a number also contribute to raise our prices. Thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
both those questions are in our favor at home, against us
abroad.</p>

<p>The employing, however, of our own ships and raising a
breed of seamen among us, though it should not be a matter
of so much private profit as some imagine, is nevertheless
of political importance, and must have weight in considering
this subject.</p>

<p>The judgment you make of the conduct of France in
the peace, and the greater glory acquired by her moderation
than even by her arms, appears to me perfectly just.
The character of this Court and nation seems, of late
years, to be considerably changed. The ideas of aggrandisement
by conquest are out of fashion, and those of
commerce are more enlightened and more generous than
heretofore. We shall soon, I believe, feel something of
this in our being admitted to a greater freedom of trade
with their Islands. The wise here think France great
enough; and its ambition at present seems to be only that
of justice and magnanimity towards other nations, fidelity
and utility to its allies.</p>

<p>The Ambassador of Portugal was much pleased with
the proceedings relating to their vessel, which you sent
me, and assures me they will have a good effect at his
Court. He appears extremely desirous of a treaty with
our States; I have accordingly proposed to him the plan
of one (nearly the same with that sent me for Sweden)
and after my agreeing to some alterations, he has sent
it to his Court for approbation. He told me at Versailles,
last Tuesday, that he expected its return to him
on Saturday next, and anxiously desired that I would
not despatch our packet without it, that Congress might
consider it, and, if approved, send a commission to me or
some other Minister to sign it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>I venture to go thus far in treating, on the authority only
of a kind of general power, given formerly by a resolution
of Congress to Messrs Franklin, Deane, and Lee; but a
special commission seems more proper to complete a treaty,
and more agreeable to the usual forms of such business.</p>

<p>I am in just the same situation with Denmark; that
Court by its Minister here has desired a treaty with us.
I have proposed a plan formed on that sent me for Sweden;
it has been under consideration some time at Copenhagen,
and is expected here this week, so that I may
possibly send that also by this conveyance. You will have
seen by my letter to the Danish Prime Minister, that I did
not forget the affair of the prizes. What I then wrote,
produced a verbal offer made me here, of ¬£10,000 sterling,
proposed to be given by his Majesty to the captors, if
I would accept it as a full discharge of our demand. I
could not do this, I said, because it was not more than a fifth
part of the estimated value. In answer, I was told that the
estimation was probably extravagant, that it would be difficult
to come at the knowledge of their true value, and that
whatever they might be worth in themselves, they should
not be estimated as of such value to us when at Bergen,
since the English probably watched them, and might have
retaken them in their way to America; at least, they were
at the common risk of the seas and enemies, and the insurance
was a considerable drawback; that this sum might
be considered as so much saved for us by the King's
interference; for that if the English claimants had been
suffered to carry the cause into the common courts, they
must have recovered the prizes by the laws of Denmark;
it was added, that the King's honor was concerned, that
he sincerely desired our friendship, but he would avoid,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
by giving this sum in the form of a present to the captors,
the appearance of its being exacted from him as
the reparation of an injury, when it was really intended
rather as a proof of his strong disposition to cultivate a
good understanding with us.</p>

<p>I replied, that the value might possibly be exaggerated;
but that we did not desire more than should be found just
on inquiry, and that it was not difficult to learn from London
what sums were insured upon the ships and cargoes,
which would be some guide; and that a reasonable abatement
might be made for the risk; but that the Congress
could not, in justice to their mariners, deprive them of any
part that was truly due to those brave men, whatever
abatement they might think fit to make (as a mark of their
regard for the King's friendship) of the part belonging to
the public; that I had, however, no instructions or authority
to make any abatement of any kind, and could,
therefore, only acquaint Congress with the offer, and the
reasons that accompanied it, which I promised to state
fully and candidly (as I have now done) and attend their
orders, desiring only that it might be observed, we had
presented our complaint with decency, that we had charged
no fault on the Danish government, but what might
arise from inattention or precipitancy, and that we had
intimated no resentment, but had waited with patience and
respect the King's determination, confiding, that he would
follow the equitable disposition of his own breast, by doing
us justice as soon as he could do it with conveniency;
that the best and wisest Princes sometimes erred, that it
belonged to the condition of man, and was, therefore, inevitable,
and that the true honor in such cases consisted
not in disowning or hiding the error, but in making ample<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
reparation; that, though I could not accept what was offered
on the terms proposed, our treaty might go on, and
its articles be prepared and considered, and, in the mean
time, I hoped his Danish Majesty would reconsider the
offer, and make it more adequate to the loss we had sustained.
Thus that matter rests; but I hourly expect to
hear further, and perhaps may have more to say on it before
the ship's departure.</p>

<p>I shall be glad to have the proceedings you mention
respecting the brig Providentia. I hope the equity and
justice of our Admiralty Courts, respecting the property
of strangers, will always maintain their reputation, and I
wish particularly to cultivate the disposition of friendship
towards us, apparent in the late proceedings of Denmark,
as the Danish Islands may be of use to our West India
commerce, while the English impolitic restraints continue.</p>

<p>The Elector of Saxony, as I understand from his Minister
here, has thoughts of sending one to Congress, and
proposing a treaty of commerce and amity with us. Prussia
has likewise an inclination to share in a trade with America,
and the Minister of that Court, though he has not directly
proposed a treaty, has given me a packet of lists of the
several sorts of merchandise they can furnish us with,
which he requests me to send to America for the information
of our merchants.</p>

<p>I have received no answer yet from Congress to my request
of being dismissed from their service. They should,
methinks, reflect, that if they continue me here, the faults
I may henceforth commit, through the infirmities of age,
will be rather theirs than mine. I am glad my journal
afforded you any pleasure. I will, as you desire, endeavor
to continue it. I thank you for the pamphlet; it contains a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
great deal of information respecting our finances. We
shall, as you advise, avoid publishing it. But I see they
are publishing it in the English papers. I was glad I
had a copy authenticated by the signature of Secretary
Thompson, by which I could assure Count de Vergennes,
that the money contract I had made with him was ratified
by Congress, he having just before expressed some uneasiness
to me at its being so long neglected. I find it was
ratified soon after it was received, but the ratification, except
in that pamphlet, has not yet come to hand. I have
done my best to procure the further loan directed by the
resolution of Congress. It was not possible. I have written
on that matter to Mr Morris. I wish the rest of the
estimates of losses and mischiefs were come to hand; they
would still be of use.</p>

<p>Mr Barclay has in his hands the affair of the Alliance
and Bon Homme Richard. I will afford him all the assistance
in my power, but it is a very perplexed business.
That expedition, though for particular reasons under
American commissions and colors, was carried on at the
King's expense, and under his orders. M. de Chaumont
was the agent appointed by the Minister of Marine to
make the outfit. He was also chosen by all the captains
of the squadron, as appears by an instrument under their
hands, to be their agent, receive, sell, and divide prizes,
&amp;c. The Crown bought two of them at public sale, and
the money I understand is lodged in the hands of a responsible
person at L'Orient. M. de Chaumont says he
has given in his accounts to the Marine, and that he has
no more to do with the affair, except to receive a balance
due to him. That account, however, is I believe unsettled,
and the absence of some of the captains is said to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
make another difficulty, which retards the completion of
the business. I never paid or received anything relating
to that expedition, nor had any other concern in it, than
barely ordering the Alliance to join the squadron at M.
de Sartine's request. I know not whether the other captains
will not claim a share in what we may obtain from
Denmark, though the prizes were made by the Alliance,
when separate from the squadron. If so, that is another
difficulty in the way of making abatement in our demand,
without their consent.</p>

<p>I am sorry to find, that you have thoughts of quitting
the service. I do not think your place can be easily well
supplied. You mention, that an entire new arrangement,
with respect to foreign affairs, is under consideration. I
wish to know whether any notice is likely to be taken in it
of my grandson. He has now gone through an apprenticeship
of near seven years in the Ministerial business,
and is very capable of serving the States in that line, as
possessing all the requisites of knowledge, zeal, activity,
language, and address. He is well liked here, and Count
de Vergennes has expressed to me in warm terms his very
good opinion of him. The late Swedish Ambassador,
Count de Creutz, who has gone home to be Prime Minister,
desired I would endeavor to procure his being sent to
Sweden, with a public character, assuring me, that he
should be glad to receive him there as our Minister, and
that he knew it would be pleasing to the King.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> The
present Swedish Ambassador has also proposed the same
thing to me, as you will see by a letter of his, which I
enclose.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> One of the Danish Ministers, M. Walterstorff,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
who will probably be sent in a public character to Congress,
has also expressed his wish, that my grandson may
be sent to Denmark. But it is not my custom to solicit
employments for myself, or any of my family, and I shall
not do it in this case. I only hope, that if he is not to be
employed in your new arrangement, I may be informed of
it as soon as possible, that while I have strength left for it,
I may accompany him in a tour to Italy, returning through
Germany, which I think he may make to more advantage
with me than alone, and which I have long promised to
afford him, as a reward for his faithful service, and his
tender filial attachment to me.</p>

<p><em>July 25th.</em> While I was writing the above M. Walterstorff
came in, and delivered me a packet from M. Rosencrone,
the Danish Prime Minister, containing the project of
the treaty with some proposed alterations, and a paper of
reasons in support of them.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> Fearing that we should not
have time to copy them, I send herewith the originals, relying
on his promise to furnish me with copies in a few
days. He seemed to think, that the interest of the merchants
is concerned in the immediate conclusion of the
treaty, that they may form their plans of commerce, and
wished to know whether I did not think my general power,
above mentioned, sufficient for that purpose. I told him I
thought a particular commission more agreeable to the
forms, but if his Danish Majesty would be content for the
present with the general authority, formerly given to me, I
believed I might venture to act upon it, reserving by a separate
article to Congress the power of shortening the term<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
in case any part of the treaty should not be to their mind,
unless the alteration of such part should hereafter be
agreed on.</p>

<p>The Prince de Deuxponts was lately at Paris, and applied
to me for information, respecting a commerce which
is desired between the Electorate of Bavaria and America.
I have it also from a good hand at the Court of Vienna,
that the Emperor is desirous of establishing a commerce
with us from Trieste, as well as Flanders, and would
make a treaty with us if proposed to him. Since our trade
is laid open, and no longer a monopoly to England, all
Europe seems desirous of sharing in it, and for that purpose
to cultivate our friendship. That it may be better
known everywhere, what sort of people, and what kind of
government they will have to treat with, I prevailed with
our friend, the Duc de la Rochefoucault, to translate our
book of Constitutions into French, and I presented copies
to all the Foreign Ministers. I send you one herewith.
They are much admired by the politicians here, and it is
thought will induce considerable emigrations of substantial
people from different parts of Europe to America. It is
particularly a matter of wonder, that in the midst of a cruel
war, raging in the bowels of our country, our sages should
have the firmness of mind to sit down calmly and form
such complete plans of government. They add considerably
to the reputation of the United States.</p>

<p>I have mentioned above the port of Trieste, with which
we may possibly have a commerce, and I am told that
many useful productions and manufactures of Hungary
may be had extremely cheap there. But it becomes necessary
first to consider how our Mediterranean trade is to
be protected from the corsairs of Barbary. You will see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
by the enclosed copy of a letter<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> I received from Algiers,
the danger two of our ships escaped last winter. I think
it not improbable, that those rovers may be privately encouraged
by the English to fall upon us, and to prevent
our interference in the carrying trade; for I have in London
heard it is a maxim among the merchants, that if
<em>there were no Algiers, it would be worth England's while
to build one</em>. I wonder, however, that the rest of Europe
do not combine to destroy those nests, and secure commerce
from their future piracies.</p>

<p>I made the Grand Master of Malta a present of one of
our medals in silver, writing to him a letter, of which I enclose
a copy;<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> and I believe our people will be kindly
received in his ports; but that is not sufficient; and perhaps
now we have peace, it will be proper to send Ministers,
with suitable presents, to establish a friendship with the
Emperor of Morocco, and the other Barbary States, if possible.
Mr Jay will inform you of some steps, that have been
taken by a person at Alicant, without authority, towards a
treaty with that Emperor. I send you herewith a few
more of the abovementioned medals, which have given
great satisfaction to this Court and nation. I should be glad
to know how they are liked with you.</p>

<p>Our people, who were prisoners in England, are now
all discharged. During the whole war, those who were in
Forton prison, near Portsmouth, were much befriended by
the constant charitable care of Mr Wren, a Presbyterian
minister there, who spared no pains to assist them in their
sickness and distress, by procuring and distributing among
them the contributions of good Christians, and prudently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
dispensing the allowance I made them, which gave him
a great deal of trouble, but he went through it cheerfully.
I think some public notice should be taken of this good
man. I wish the Congress would enable me to make him
a present, and that some of our universities would confer
upon him the degree of Doctor.</p>

<p>The Duke of Manchester, who has always been our
friend in the House of Lords, is now here as Ambassador
from England. I dine with him today, 26th, and if anything
of importance occurs, I will add it in a postscript.
Be pleased to present my dutiful respects to the Congress,
assure them of my most faithful services, and believe me
to be, with great and sincere esteem, Sir, &amp;c.</p>

<h3>PLAN OF A TREATY WITH PORTUGAL.</h3>

<p>Plan of a Treaty of Amity and Commerce between Her
Most Faithful Majesty, the Queen of Portugal and Algarva,
and the United States of North America.</p>

<p>Her Most Faithful Majesty, the Queen of Portugal and
Algarva, and the United States of North America, anxious
to fix in an equitable and permanent manner the regulation,
which ought to be observed with regard to the commerce
they wish to establish between their respective
countries, conceive that they cannot more effectually attain
this end than by observing as the basis of their arrangement
the most perfect equality and reciprocity, allowing
each party the liberty of making such interior regulations
respecting their commerce and navigation as may best suit
them, resting the advantages of commerce on its reciprocal
utility and the laws of a just concurrence. In consequence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
of these principles, and of a mature deliberation, Her Most
Faithful Majesty and the United States have agreed on the
following articles.</p>


<h4>ARTICLE I.</h4>

<p>There shall be a firm, inviolable, and universal peace,
and a sincere amity between Her Most Faithful Majesty,
the Queen of Portugal, her heirs and successors, and the
United States of North America, as well with respect to
the citizens and subjects of the said two parties as their
people, islands, cities, and places situated within their
respective jurisdictions, and between their people and inhabitants
of all classes, without exception of persons and
places, similar to what has been already established with
the most favorite powers.</p>


<h4>ARTICLE II.</h4>

<p>The subjects of Her Most Faithful Majesty may freely
frequent and reside in the United States, and traffic in all
kinds of effects and merchandises, whose importation or
exportation is not or shall not be prohibited, and they shall
not pay in the ports, harbors, roads, countries, islands,
cities, and places within the United States, other or greater
duties or imposts of any kind whatever, than such as the
most favored nations are, or shall be, obliged to pay. And
they shall enjoy all the rights, liberties, privileges, immunities,
and exemptions with respect to trade, navigation, and
commerce, whether in going from one port of the said
States to another, or in going there, or returning from any
part or to any part of the world whatever, which the said
nations do or shall enjoy.</p>


<h4>ARTICLE III.</h4>

<p>In the like manner the citizens and inhabitants of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
United States of North America shall freely frequent and
reside in the States of Her Most Faithful Majesty in Europe;
also in Madeira and the Azores, and trade there in
all kinds of effects and merchandises, the importation and
exportation of which is not, or shall not be prohibited, and
they shall not pay in the ports, harbors, roads, countries,
islands, cities, and places of the Queen of Portugal, other
or greater duties of any kind whatsoever than such as the
most favored nations are, or shall be, bound to pay; and
they shall enjoy all the rights, liberties, privileges,
immunities, and exemptions as to trade, navigation, and commerce,
whether in going from one port of Her Most Faithful Majesty's
States to another, or in going there, or returning
from any part of the world whatever, which the said nations
do or shall enjoy.</p>


<h4>ARTICLE IV.</h4>

<p>Her Most Faithful Majesty shall use every means in her
power to protect and defend all the vessels and property
belonging to the subjects, people, and inhabitants of the
said United States, which shall be in her ports, harbors,
or roads, against any violence whatever that may be committed
by the subjects of her said Majesty, by punishing
such as shall violate these principles.</p>


<h4>ARTICLE V.</h4>

<p>The preceding article, shall be in like manner reciprocally
and exactly observed on the part of the United
States, with respect to the vessels and property belonging
to the subjects of her said Majesty, which shall be found in
their ports, harbors, or roads, against any violence that may
be committed by the subjects of the United States.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<h4>ARTICLE VI.</h4>

<p>If any squadrons or vessels of war touch at the ports, or
enter into the seas in the neighborhood of Her Most Faithful
Majesty's States, they shall conform to the regulations
already established with respect to the other most favored
maritime powers.</p>


<h4>ARTICLE VII.</h4>

<p>The United States of America likewise oblige themselves
reciprocally to observe with exactitude the stipulations
contained in the above article.</p>


<h4>ARTICLE VIII.</h4>

<p>It is likewise agreed and determined that every merchant,
captains of merchant vessels, or other subjects of
Her Most Faithful Majesty, shall have entire liberty in all
places within the dominion or jurisdiction of the United
States of America, to manage themselves their own affairs,
and to employ therein whomsoever they please, and that
they shall not be obliged to make use of any interpreter
or broker, nor to pay them any fee, unless they do employ
them. Moreover, the masters of the vessels shall not be
obliged, in loading or discharging their vessels, to employ
workmen, appointed for that purpose by public authority,
but they shall be entirely free to discharge or load themselves
their vessels, and to employ, in loading or discharging,
such persons as they shall think proper for the purpose,
without paying any fee, under the title of salary, to
any other person whatever, and they shall not be obliged
to put any kind of merchandise in other vessels, or to receive
them on board, and wait to be loaded any longer
time than what they please, and all and every of the citizens,
people, and inhabitants of the United States of America<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
shall have, and shall reciprocally enjoy, the same privileges
and liberties in all the aforesaid places within Her
Most Faithful Majesty's jurisdiction in Europe. And, as to
what concerns contraband goods, which may be introduced
in merchant vessels belonging to either nation, they shall
be obliged to submit to the visit of the officers appointed
in the two States, to prevent the said contraband, and, for
that purpose to conform to the established regulations, or
such as shall be established within the respective States.</p>


<h4>ARTICLE IX.</h4>

<p>Full and entire liberty of conscience shall be granted to
the inhabitants and subjects of each party, and no one shall
be molested with respect to his worship, provided he submits,
as far as respects the public demonstration, to the laws
of the country. The inhabitants and subjects of either
party, who shall die in the territory of the other party, shall
be permitted to be buried in suitable and decent places,
which shall be assigned for that purpose, and the two contracting
powers shall provide, each within its own jurisdiction,
that the respective subjects and inhabitants may obtain
certificates of death, in case they shall be required to deliver
them.</p>


<h4>ARTICLE X.</h4>

<p>The subjects of the contracting parties may, within the
respective States, freely dispose of their property, moveable
and immoveable, either by testament, donation, or
otherwise, in favor of such persons as they may think
proper, and their heirs, wherever they may dwell, shall
receive these successions, even ab intestato, either in person
or by attorney, without the necessity of obtaining
letters of naturalization. These inheritances, as well as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
the capitals and effects, which the subjects of the two
parties, in changing their residence, would carry from the
place of their abode, shall be exempted from any duties
on the part of the government of the two respective States.
The contents of this article shall in no wise derogate from
the ordinances published against emigrations, or which
shall hereafter be promulgated within the dominions of the
two powers, the exercise of which they reserve to themselves.</p>


<h4>ARTICLE XI.</h4>

<p>If, hereafter, a war should happen between Portugal
and the United States, which God forbid, the space of nine
months shall be granted to the merchants of either country
residing at that time in the other, to collect their debts
and put their affairs in order, and they may depart with all
their effects without let or molestation. All fishermen,
farmers, artisans, or manufacturers, unarmed and residing
in cities, places, and villages not fortified, who work for
the subsistence and welfare of mankind, and who peaceably
exercise their respective employments, shall be allowed
to continue their occupations without molestation
from the armed forces of the enemy, in whose power they
may fall through the events of war; but should it be necessary
to take anything from them for the use of the
army, they shall be paid for them at a reasonable price.
All traders and merchants, whose vessels shall not be
armed for war, but employed in the commerce of exchanging
the productions of different countries, and thereby
rendering the wants, conveniences, and comforts of life
easier to be obtained and more universal, shall be permitted
to pass freely, and without molestation. Neither of
the contracting powers shall grant a commission to any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
privateer, authorising it to take or destroy such merchant
vessels, or to interrupt such commerce.</p>


<h4>ARTICLE XII.</h4>

<p>In order to remove and prevent on both sides every
difficulty and misunderstanding, that commonly happen respecting
merchandise heretofore denominated contraband,
and which shall be judged such by the powers of Europe
in their respective treaties, that is to say, arms and warlike
stores, it has been agreed, that in case where one of
the contracting parties shall be engaged in a war against
any other nation, none of these articles carried in the
vessels, or by the subjects of one of the parties to the enemies
of the other, shall be considered contraband under
any pretext whatever, nor be confiscated or taken away as
such from any individual. It shall, nevertheless, be lawful
to stop such vessels, and to detain them as long as the
captors shall think necessary to prevent the inconveniencies
or damages that may result from the continuation of
their voyage, by paying, however, to the proprietors a reasonable
compensation for the loss, which such detention
may occasion; moreover, the captors shall be permitted to
use, in whole or in part, the warlike stores thus detained,
provided that they pay the full value thereof to the proprietors.</p>


<h4>ARTICLE XIII.</h4>

<p>All vessels and merchandise of whatsoever kind, that
shall be recovered from pirates of the high seas, shall be
brought into some port of one of the two States and delivered
to the care of the officers of the said port, in order
that they may be completely restored to their true proprietor,
as soon as he shall have duly and sufficiently proved
his property.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>


<h4>ARTICLE XIV.</h4>

<p>None of Her Most Faithful Majesty's subjects shall take
a commission or letter of marque to arm any vessel or
vessels for the purpose of acting as privateers against the
United States, or any of them, or against their subjects,
people, or inhabitants, or against their property, or that of
the inhabitants of either of them, from any prince whatever,
with whom the said States shall be at war. In like
manner, no citizen, or subject, or inhabitant of the aforesaid
United States, or any of them, shall demand any commission
or letter of marque to arm any vessel or vessels to
cruise against the subjects of Her Most Faithful Majesty,
or any of them, or their property, from any prince or State
whatever with whom the said Queen shall be at war; and
if any one belonging to either nation takes such commission
or letter of marque, he shall be punished as a pirate.</p>


<h4>ARTICLE XV.</h4>

<p>In case the vessels, subjects, and inhabitants of one of
the two contracting parties shall approach the coasts of the
other, without designing, however, to enter into the port,
or, after having entered, without intention to discharge their
cargo, or to break bulk, they shall be at liberty to depart
or to pursue their voyage without molestation.</p>


<h4>ARTICLE XVI.</h4>

<p>It is stipulated by the present treaty, that free vessels
shall secure the liberty of the persons who shall be on
board, even should they be the enemies of one of the two
contracting parties, and they shall not be taken out of the
said vessels unless they are military characters, and actually
in the enemy's service.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>


<h4>ARTICLE XVII.</h4>

<p>The two contracting parties mutually grant permission
to maintain in their respective ports, consuls, vice consuls,
agents, and commissaries, whose functions shall be regulated
by a particular convention, whenever either party may
be pleased to establish it.</p>


<h4>ARTICLE XVIII.</h4>

<p>The present treaty shall be ratified on both sides, and
the ratifications shall be exchanged in the space of eight
months, or sooner if possible, reckoning from the date of
the signature.</p>


<h4>ARTICLE XIX.</h4>

<p>Her Most Faithful Majesty, the Queen of Portugal and
Algarva, and the United States of North America, agree
that the present treaty shall be in full force, reckoning
from the date of its ratification, and the two contracting
parties reciprocally promise to observe it exactly.</p>

<h3>FROM THE POPE'S NUNCIO TO B. FRANKLIN.</h3>

<h4>Translation.</h4>

<p>The Apostolical Nuncio has the honor to send Mr
Franklin the enclosed note, which he requests he will
be pleased to forward to the Congress of the United
States of North America, and support it with his credit.</p>

<h4>NOTE.</h4>

<p>Before the revolution, which has just been completed in
North America, the Catholics and missionaries of those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
provinces depended, as to their spiritual concerns, on the
Apostolical Vicar, resident in London. It is well known
that this arrangement can no longer exist; but as it is essential
that the Catholic subjects of the United States
should have an ecclesiastic to govern them in their religious
concerns, the congregation <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">de Propagand√¢ Fide</i>
existing at Rome for the establishment and conservation of
missions, has come to the determination of proposing to
Congress to establish, in some city of the United States of
North America, one of their Catholic subjects, with the
powers of Apostolical Vicar, and in the character of
Bishop, or simply in quality of Apostolical Prefect.</p>

<p>The establishment of an Apostolical Vicar Bishop appears
the most eligible, the more so as the Catholic
subjects of the United States would find themselves in a
situation to receive confirmation and orders in their own
country, without being obliged to go for that purpose to
the country of a foreign power. And as it might sometimes
happen, that among the subjects of the United
States, there might be no person in a situation to be
charged with the spiritual government, either as Bishop
or Apostolical Prefect, it would be necessary, in such
circumstances, that Congress should consent to choose
him from among the subjects of a foreign nation the most
friendly with the United States.</p>

<h3>TO DAVID HARTLEY.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">
Passy, September 6th, 1783.</p>

<p class="letter_open">My Dear Friend,
</p>

<p>Enclosed is my letter to Mr Fox. I beg you would
assure him, that my expressions of esteem for him are not
mere professions. I really think him a <em>great</em> man, and I
would not think so if I did not believe he was at bottom,
and would prove himself a <em>good</em> one. Guard him against
mistaken notions of the American people. You have deceived
yourselves too long with vain expectations of reaping
advantage from our little discontents. We are more
thoroughly an enlightened people, with respect to our political
interests, than perhaps any other under Heaven.
Every man among us reads, and is so easy in his circumstances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
as to have leisure for conversations of improvement,
and for acquiring information. Our domestic misunderstandings,
when we have them, are of small extent,
though monstrously magnified by your microscopic newspapers.
He who judges from them, that we are on the
point of falling into anarchy, or returning to the obedience
of Britain, is like one who being shown some spots in the
sun should fancy, that the whole disk would soon be overspread
with them, and that there would be an end of daylight.
The great body of intelligence among our people,
surrounds and overpowers our petty dissensions, as the
sun's great mass of fire diminishes and destroys his spots.
Do not, therefore, any longer delay the evacuation of New
York, in the vain hope of a new revolution in your favor,
if such a hope has indeed had any effect in occasioning
the delay. It is now nine months since the evacuations
were promised. You expect with reason, that the people
of New York should do your merchants justice in the payment
of their old debts; consider the injustice you do
them in keeping them so long out of their habitations, and
out of their business, by which they might have been enabled
to make payment. There is no truth more clear to
me than this, that the great interests of our two countries
is a thorough reconciliation. Restraints on the freedom of
commerce and intercourse between us, can afford no advantage
equivalent to the mischief they will do, by keeping
up ill humor and promoting a total alienation. Let you
and me, my dear friend, do our best towards advancing
and securing that reconciliation. We can do nothing,
that will in a dying hour afford us more solid satisfaction.</p>

<p>I wish you a prosperous journey, and a happy sight of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
your friends. Present my best respects to your good
brother and sister, and believe me ever, with sincere and
great esteem, yours affectionately,</p>

<h3>TO JOHN JAY.</h3>
<p class="letter_head">
Passy, September 10th, 1783.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,
</p>

<p>I have received a letter from a very respectable person
in America, containing the following words, viz.</p>

<p>"It is confidently reported, propagated, and believed by
some among us, that the Court of France was at the bottom
against our obtaining the fishery and territory in that
great extent, in which both are secured to us by the
treaty; that our Minister at that Court favored, or did not
oppose this design against us, and that it was entirely owing
to the firmness, sagacity, and disinterestedness of Mr
Adams, with whom Mr Jay united, that we have obtained
these important advantages."</p>

<p>It is not my purpose to dispute any share of the honor
of that treaty, which the friends of my colleagues may be
disposed to give them, but having now spent fifty years of
my life in public offices and trusts, and having still one
ambition left, that of carrying the character of fidelity at
least to the grave with me, I cannot allow that I was behind
any of them in zeal and faithfulness. I therefore
think, that I ought not to suffer an accusation, which falls
little short of treason to my country, to pass without notice,
when the means of effectual vindication are at hand.
You, Sir, were a witness of my conduct in that affair. To
you and my other colleagues I appeal, by sending to each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
a similar letter with this, and I have no doubt of your
readiness to do a brother Commissioner justice, by certificates,
that will entirely destroy the effect of that accusation.</p>

<h3>JOHN JAY TO B. FRANKLIN.</h3>

<p class="signature">
Passy, September 11th, 1783.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,
</p>

<p>I have been favored with your letter of yesterday, and
will answer it explicitly. I have no reason whatever to
believe, that you were averse to our obtaining the full extent
of boundary and fishery secured to us by the treaty.
Your conduct respecting them throughout the negotiation
indicated a strong, a steady attachment to both those
objects, and in my opinion promoted the attainment of
them.</p>

<p>I remember, that in a conversation, which M. de Rayneval,
the first Secretary of Count de Vergennes, had
with you and me, in the summer of 1782, you contended
for our full right to the fishery, and argued it on various
principles.</p>

<p>Your letters to me, when in Spain, considered our territory
as extending to the Mississippi, and expressed your
opinion against ceding the navigation of that river, in very
strong and pointed terms.</p>

<p>In short, Sir, I do not recollect the least difference in
sentiment between us respecting the boundaries or fisheries.
On the contrary, we were unanimous and united in adhering
to, and insisting on them. Nor did I perceive the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
least disposition in either of us to recede from our claims,
or be satisfied with less than we obtained.</p>

<h3>JOHN ADAMS TO B. FRANKLIN.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">
Paris, September 13th, 1783.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,
</p>

<p>I have received the letter, which you did me the honor
to write me on the 10th of this month, in which you say
you have received a letter from a very respectable person
in America, containing the following words, viz. "It is
confidently reported, propagated, and believed by some
among us, that the Court of France was at the bottom
against our obtaining the fishery and territory in
that great extent, in which both are secured to us by the
treaty; that our Minister at that Court favored, or did
not oppose this design against us, and that it was entirely
owing to the firmness, sagacity, and disinterestedness of
Mr Adams, with whom Mr Jay united, that we have obtained
those important advantages."</p>

<p>It is unnecessary for me to say anything upon this subject,
more than to quote the words which I wrote in the
evening of the 30th of November, 1782, and which have
been received and read in Congress, viz; "As soon as I
arrived in Paris, I waited on Mr Jay, and learned from
him the rise and progress of the negotiation. Nothing that
has happened, since the beginning of the controversy in
1761, has ever struck me more forcibly or affected me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
more intimately, than that entire coincidence of principles
and opinion between him and me. In about three days
I went out to Passy, and spent the evening with Dr Franklin,
and entered largely into conversation with him upon
the course and present state of our foreign affairs. I told
him my opinion without reserve of the policy of this
Court, and of the principles, wisdom, and firmness with
which Mr Jay had conducted the negotiation in his sickness
and my absence, and that I was determined to support
Mr Jay to the utmost of my power in pursuit of the
same system. The Doctor heard me patiently and said
nothing."</p>

<p>"The first conference we had afterwards with Mr Oswald
in considering one point and another, Dr Franklin
turned to Mr Jay and said, 'I am of your opinion, and
will go on with these gentlemen without consulting this
Court.' He has accordingly met us in most of our conferences,
and has gone on with us in entire harmony and
unanimity throughout, and has been able and useful, both
by his sagacity and reputation, in the whole negotiation."<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>
I have the honor to be, very respectfully, Sir,</p>
<p class="signature">JOHN ADAMS.
</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p class="letter_head">
Passy, September 13th, 1783.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,
</p>

<p>I received a few days since, the private letter your Excellency
did me the honor of writing to me of the 13th of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
June. I regret with you the resignation of the late Secretary.
Your present cares are increased by it, and it will
be difficult to find a successor of equal abilities.</p>

<p>We found no difficulty in deciphering the resolution of
Congress. The Commissioners have taken no notice of it
in our public letter.</p>

<p>I am happy to hear that both the device and workmanship
of the medal are approved with you, as they have the
good fortune to be by the best judges on this side of the
water. It has been esteemed a well-timed, as well as a
well-merited compliment here, and has its good effects.
Since the two first, which you mention as received, I have
sent by different opportunities so many, as that every member
of Congress might have one. I hope they are come
safe to hand by this time.</p>

<p>I wrote a long letter to Mr Livingston by Mr Barney, to
which I beg leave to refer, enclosing a copy.</p>

<p>We had, before signing the definitive treaty, received
the ratification of the preliminary articles by his Britannic
Majesty, exchanged with us by Mr Hartley for that of the
Congress. I send herewith a copy of the first and last
clauses.</p>

<p>In a former letter I mentioned the volunteer proceedings
of a merchant at Alicant, towards obtaining a treaty between
us and the Emperor of Morocco. We have since
received a letter from a person who says, as you will see
by the copy enclosed, that he is sent by the Emperor to
be the bearer of his answer to the United States, and that
he is arrived in Spain on his way to Paris. He has not
yet appeared here, and we hardly know what answer to
give him. I hope the sending a Minister to that Court,
as recommended in my last, has been taken into consideration,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
or at least that some instructions respecting that
nation have been sent to your Minister in Spain, who is
better situated than we are for such a negotiation.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>The Minister from Denmark often speaks to me about
the proposed treaty, of which a copy went by Mr Barney.
No commission to sign it, nor any instructions from Congress
relating to it are yet arrived; and though pressed, I
have not ventured to do anything further in the affair.</p>

<p>I forward herewith a letter to the Congress from the
city of Hamburg.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> I understand that a good disposition
towards us prevails there, which it may be well to encourage.</p>

<p>No answer has yet been given me from the Court of
Portugal, respecting the plan of a treaty concerted between
its Ambassador here and me. He has been unwell and
much in the country, so that I have not seen him lately.
I suspect that the false or exaggerated reports of the distracted
situation of our government, industriously propagated
throughout Europe by our enemies, have made an
impression in that kingdom to our disadvantage, and inclined
them to hesitate in forming a connexion with us.
Questions asked me, and observations made by several of
the foreign Ministers here, convince me that the idle
stories of our disunion, contempt of authority, refusal to
pay taxes, &amp;c. have been too much credited, and been
very injurious to our reputation.</p>

<p>I sent before a copy of the letter I wrote to the Grand
Master of Malta, with a present of our medal. With this
you will have a copy of his answer.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> I send also a copy
of a note I received from the Pope's Nuncio.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> He is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
very civil on all occasions, and has mentioned the possibility
of an advantageous trade America might have with the
Ecclesiastical State, which he says has two good ports,
Civita Vecchia, and &mdash;&mdash;.</p>

<p>This Court continues favorable to us. Count de Vergennes
was resolute in refusing to sign the definitive
treaty with England before ours was signed. The English
Ministers were offended, but complied. I am convinced
that Court will never cease endeavoring to disunite
us. We shall, I hope, be constantly on our guard against
those machinations, for our safety consists in a steady
adherence to our friends, and our reputation in a faithful
regard to treaties, and in a grateful conduct towards our
benefactors.</p>

<p>I send herewith sundry memorials recommended to my
care by Count de Vergennes, viz. one respecting a claim
of Messieurs Fosters, of Bordeaux, one of M. Pequet,
and one of M. Bayard. The Congress will take such
notice of them as they shall think proper.</p>

be, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="letter_open">My Dear Friend,
</p>

<p>I am at present at Bath with my dearest sister, whom I
have found as well as I could have expected, and I hope
with reasonable prospect of recovery in time. I have seen
my friends in the ministry, and hope things will go on well;
with them I am sure all is right and firm. The chief part
of the Cabinet Ministers are out of town, but there will be a
full cabinet held in a few days, in which a specific proposition,
in the nature of a temporary convention, will be given
in instructions to me. I imagine nearly upon the ground of
my memorial of May 19th, 1783, which I delivered to the
American Ministers, viz. "American ships not to bring foreign
manufactures into Great Britain, nor to trade directly
between the British West Indies and Great Britain;" all the
rest to be as before the war. I expect that something to this
effect will be their determination in the affair, and if it should
be so, I shall hope not to meet with difficulty on your parts.
I want to see some specific beginning. As to any further
proposition respecting the trade between Great Britain and
the British West Indies, I doubt whether any such can be
discussed before the meeting of Parliament. I wish to
look forward not only to the continuation of peace between
our two countries, but to the improvement of reconciliation
into alliance, and therefore I wish the two parties to be disposed
to accommodate each other, without the strict account
by weights and scales, as between aliens and strangers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
actuated towards each other by no other principle

which might have happened may be prevented. Pray remember
me to your three colleagues, and to all friends.</p>

with all our despatches, that were intended to go by the
French packet boat, writes from L'Orient, that though he
arrived there two days before the time appointed for her
sailing, he missed reaching her by four hours; but another
light vessel was fitting, and would sail the 21st instant, in
which he hoped to arrive at New York, nearly as soon as
the packet. We shall send duplicates by the next from
hence.</p>

<p>In the meantime I enclose a printed copy of the Definitive
Treaty, which I hear is ratified. Indeed we have the
ratification of the preliminaries.</p>

<p>Mr Hartley, when he left us, expected to return in three
weeks, in order to proceed with us in forming a treaty of
commerce. The new commission, that was intended for
us, is not yet come to hand.</p>

<p>With great respect, I have the honor to be, Sir, &amp;c.</p>

<h3>TO DAVID HARTLEY.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">
Passy, October 16th, 1783.</p>

<p class="letter_open">My Dear Friend,
</p>

<p>I have nothing material to write to you respecting public
affairs, but I cannot let Mr Adams, who will see you, go
without a line to inquire after your welfare, to inform you
of mine, and assure you of my constant respect and attachment.</p>

<p>I think with you, that your Quaker article is a good one,
and that men will in time have sense enough to adopt it,
but I fear that time is not yet come.</p>

<p>What would you think of a proposition, if I should make
it, of a compact between England, France, and America?
America would be as happy as the Sabine girls, if she
could be the means of uniting in perpetual peace her father
and her husband. What repeated follies are those repeated
wars! You do not want to conquer and govern
one another. Why then should you be continually
employed in injuring and destroying one another? How many
excellent things might have been done to promote the
internal welfare of each country; what bridges, roads,
canals, and other useful public works and institutions, tending
to the common felicity, might have been made and
established with the money and men foolishly spent, during
the last seven centuries by our mad wars in doing one
another mischief! You are near neighbors and each have
very respectable qualities. Learn to be quiet and to respect
each other's rights. You are all Christians. One is
<em>The Most Christian King</em>, and the other <em>Defender of the
Faith</em>. Manifest the propriety of these titles by your future
conduct. "By this," says Christ, "shall all men know that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
ye are my disciples, if ye love one another." Seek peace,
and insure it.</p>

</p>

<p>I received my dear friend's kind letter of the 4th instant
from Bath, with your proposed temporary convention, which
you desire me to show to my colleagues. They are both
by this time in London, where you will undoubtedly see and
converse with them on the subject. The apprehension
you mention, that the cement of the confederation may be
annihilated, &amp;c. has not, I think, any foundation. There
is sense enough in America to take care of their own china
vase. I see much in your papers about our divisions and
distractions, but I hear little of them from America; and
I know that most of the letters, said to come from there
with such accounts, are mere London fictions. I will consider
attentively the proposition abovementioned, against the
return of my colleagues, when I hope our commission will
have arrived.</p>

<p>I rejoice to hear that your dear sister's recovery advances,
and that your brother is well. Please to present
my affectionate respects to them, and believe me ever
yours, &amp;c.</p>

<h3>TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="signature">
Passy, November 1st, 1783.</p>
<p class="letter_open">
Sir,
</p>

<p>Enclosed is a copy of my last, which went by the English<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
packet. I heard after I wrote it, that the French
packet putting back by contrary winds, Mr Thaxter had an
opportunity of getting on board her, and that she sailed
the 26th of September.</p>

<p>The mentioned new commission is not yet come to hand.
Mr Hartley is not returned, and I hear will stay for the
meeting of Parliament, which is to be the 11th instant, and
he will not come hither till the recess for the Christmas
holidays. Mr Jay went to England about three weeks
since on some personal affairs; and Mr Adams followed
last week to see that country, and take some exercise during
this vacancy of business.</p>

<p>This Court is now at Fontainbleau, but will return to
Versailles in a few days. Its good disposition towards us
continues. The late failure of payment in the Caisse
d'Escompte, an institution similar to the Bank of England,
occasioned partly by its having gone too far in assisting the
government with money, and the inability of the government
to support their credit, though extremely desirous of
doing it, is a fresh proof that our not obtaining a further
loan was not occasioned by want of good will to assist us,
as some have unjustly supposed, but by a real want of the
means. Money is at present unaccountably scarce here;
what is arrived and expected in Spain since the peace it
is thought will set things right. The government has proposed
a second lottery for this year, by which they borrow
twentyfour millions, and it is filled readily. This
helps, and the Caisse d'Escompte goes on again with its
operations, but it is said the interest paid by the lottery plan
is nearly seven per cent.</p>

<p>I have received the duplicates of your Excellency's letter,
of the 15th of July, to the Commissioners, which is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
very satisfactory, though it came to hand but lately. The
first sent, via New York, has not yet appeared. I have
sent copies of it to the Hague and Madrid. The substance
is published in several papers.</p>

<p>I have acquainted the Minister of Sweden, that I have
received the ratification of the treaty, and he has written
to me that he shall be in town in a few days, when he will
make the exchange. The conclusion of the Danish treaty
waits only for the commission and instructions from Congress.
The Ambassador of Portugal informed me lately,
that his Court had our proposed plan under consideration,
and that we should soon hear from them. I sent it to
Congress by Barney, and hear the ship is arrived. A
commission and instructions will be wanting for that also,
should the Congress be disposed to conclude a treaty with
that nation.</p>

<p>I see by the public prints, that the Congress have ratified
the contract I made with the Minister here, respecting the
loans and aids we had received, but the ratification itself,
though directed to be sent me, has never come to hand,
and I am often asked for it. I beg it may be forwarded by
the first opportunity.</p>

<p>There has been with me lately M. Pierre du Calvet, a
merchant of Montreal, who, when our army was in Canada,
furnished our generals and officers with many things they
wanted, taking their receipts and promissory notes for payment;
and when the English repossessed the country, he
was imprisoned, and his estate seized, on account of the
services he had rendered us. He has shown me the originals
of his papers, which I think are genuine. He produced
also a quantity of Congress paper, which he says
he received in payment for some of the supplies, and which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
appeared to me of our first emissions, and yet all fresh and
clean, as having passed through no other hands. When
he was discharged from prison, he could not obtain permission
to go into the United States to claim the debt, but
was allowed to go to England; and from thence he came
hither to solicit payment from me. Having no authority to
meddle with such debts, and the sum being considerable, I
refused, and advised him to take passage for America, and
make his application to Congress. He said he was grown
old, much broken and weakened by near three years' imprisonment,
and that the voyage from Canada to London
had like to have been too much for him, he being sick all
the way; so that he could not think of another, though distressed
for want of his money. He appears an honest
man, and his case a hard one. I have therefore undertaken
to forward his papers, and I beg leave to recommend
them to the speedy consideration of Congress, to whom I
request you would be pleased to present my dutiful respects,
and assure them of my most faithful services.</p>

<p>With great esteem and regard, &amp;c.</p>

<h3>GIACOMO FRANCISCO CROCCO TO B. FRANKLIN.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">
Cadiz, November 25th, 1783.</p>
<p class="letter_open">Sir,
</p>

<p>On the 15th of July last, I had the honor to acquaint
your Excellency of my arrival in Europe, and that I was
appointed by his Majesty, the Emperor of Morocco, bearer
of the answer to the Congress, Sovereign of the Thirteen
United States of North America, and that according to my
instructions, I was to meet at Paris the Ambassador, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
would be appointed by the Congress, to sign at the Court
of Morocco the treaty of peace and commerce, agreeably
to the proposals made to his Imperial Majesty, by Robert
Montgomery, in his letter dated at Alicant, the 4th of
January, 1783. Since I have been at the Court of Madrid,
where I had some commissions from the Emperor, and to
see the execution of them, I came to this place, from
whence I intend to embark in three or four months for
Barbary, unless in the meantime I should receive an answer
from your Excellency, with orders, that Mr Richard
Harrison should give me for my travelling charges fifteen
hundred hard dollars, although the Courts of Europe are
accustomed to allow the Ministers of my master at the rate
of ten pounds sterling per day, while they are in Europe,
to defray their expenses, besides presents for their good
offices in those important affairs.</p>

<p>His Imperial Majesty was graciously pleased at my solicitation
to agree at the request of Congress, to grant them
a treaty of peace, (which other powers in Europe could not
obtain but after many years) and my return, without the
full execution of his commands, I apprehend may forever
indispose him against the United Provinces.</p>

<p>
I remain most truly, Sir, &amp;c.</p>

<h3>TO WILLIAM CARMICHAEL.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">
Passy, December 15th, 1783.</p>

<p class="letter_open">My Dear Friend,
</p>

<p>I am much concerned to find by your letter to my
grandson, that you are hurt by my long silence, and that
you ascribe it to a supposed diminution of my friendship.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
Believe me, that is by no means the case, but I am too
much harassed by a variety of correspondence, together
with gout and gravel, which induce me to postpone doing
what I often fully intend to do, and particularly writing,
where the urgent necessity of business does not seem to
require its being done immediately, my sitting too much
at the desk having already almost killed me, besides, since
Mr Jay's residence here, I imagined he might keep you
fully informed of what was material for you to know, and
I beg you to be assured of my constant and sincere esteem
and affection.</p>

<p>I do not know whether you have been informed, that a
Mr Montgomery, who lives at Alicant, took upon himself,
(for I think he had no authority,) to make overtures last
winter in behalf of our States, towards a treaty with the
Emperor of Morocco. In consequence of his proceedings
I received a letter in August, from a person who acquainted
me, that he was arrived in Spain by the Emperor's
order, and was to come to Paris, there to receive and
conduct to Morocco the Minister of Congress appointed to
make that treaty, intimating at the same time an expectation
of money to defray his expenses. I communicated
the letter to Mr Jay. The conduct of Mr Montgomery
appeared to us very extraordinary and irregular, and the
idea of a messenger from Morocco coming to Paris to
meet and conduct a Minister of Congress appearing absurd
and extravagant, as well as the demand of money by a
person unknown, I made no answer to the letter, and I
know not whether Mr Jay made any to Mr Montgomery,
who wrote about the same time. But I have lately received
another letter from the same person, a copy of
which I enclose, together with my answer open for your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
perusal, and it is submitted to your discretion whether to
forward it or not. The Mr <em>Crocco</em>, who writes to me,
having been, as he says, at Madrid, you possibly may
know more of him than I can, and judge whether he is
really a person in credit with the Emperor, and sent as he
pretends to be, or not rather an <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Escroc</i>, as the French call
cheats and impostors.</p>

<p>I would not be wanting in anything proper for me to do
towards keeping that Prince in good humor with us, till
the pleasure of Congress is known, and therefore would
answer Mr Crocco if he be in his employ; but am loth
to commit myself in correspondence with a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Fripon</i>. It
will be strange if, being at Madrid, he did not address
himself to you.</p>

<p>With great and unalterable regard, I am ever, my dear
friend, yours most affectionately,</p>

<h3>TO GIACOMO FRANCISCO CROCCO.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">
Passy, December 15th, 1783.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,
</p>

<p>I have just received the letter you did me the honor of
writing to me the 25th past. I did indeed receive your
former letter of July, but being totally a stranger to the
mentioned proceedings of Mr Montgomery, and having no
orders from Congress on the subject, I knew not how to
give you any satisfactory answer, till I should receive further
information; and I communicated your letter to Mr
Jay, Minister of the United States for Spain, in whose district
Mr Montgomery is, and who is more at hand than I
am for commencing that negotiation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr Jay, who is at present in England, has possibly written
to you, though his letter may have miscarried, to acquaint
you, that Mr Montgomery had probably no authority
from Congress to take the step he has done, and that
it was not likely that they, desiring to make a treaty with
the Emperor, would think of putting his Majesty to the
trouble of sending a person to Paris to receive and conduct
their Minister, since they have ships, and could easily land
him at Cadiz, or present him at one of the Emperor's
ports. We have, however, written to Congress, acquainting
them with what we had been informed, of the good
and favorable disposition of his Imperial Majesty, to enter
into a treaty of amity and commerce with the United
States, and we have no doubt but that, as soon as their
affairs are a little settled, which, by so severe a war carried
on in the bowels of their country, by one of the most
powerful nations of Europe, have necessarily been much
deranged, they will readily manifest equally good dispositions,
and take all the proper steps to cultivate and secure
the friendship of a monarch, whose character I know they
have long esteemed and respected.</p>

<h3>TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">
Passy, December 25th, 1783.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,
</p>

<p>Not having heard of the appointment of a new Secretary
for Foreign Affairs, I take the liberty of addressing
this despatch directly to your Excellency. I received by
Captain Barney a letter from the late President, directed
to the Commissioners, dated November the 1st, with a set<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
of instructions, dated the 29th of October, a resolution of
the same date respecting Hamburg, and another of the
1st of November, relating to Captain Paul Jones, all which
will be duly regarded.</p>

<p>Captain Jones, in passing through England, communicated
these papers to Mr Adams then at London. Mr
Adams, disappointed in not finding among them the commission
we had been made to expect, empowering us to
make a treaty of commerce with England, wrote to me,
that he imagined it might be contained in a packet that
was directed to me, and requested to be immediately informed,
adding, that in case no such commission was come
he should depart directly for Holland; so I suppose he is
now there. Mr Laurens is gone to England, with an intention
of embarking soon for America. Mr Jay is at
Bath, but expected here daily. The English Ministers,
the Duke of Manchester and Mr Hartley, are both at
present in Parliament. As soon as either of them returns,
we shall endeavor to obtain an additional article to the
treaty, explaining that mentioned in the instructions.</p>

<p>The affairs of Ireland are still unsettled. The Parliament
and volunteers are at variance; the latter are uneasy,
that in the late negotiations for a treaty of commerce between
England and America, the British Ministers had
made no mention of Ireland, and they seem to desire a
separate treaty of commerce between America and that
kingdom.</p>

<p>It was certainly disagreeable to the English Ministers,
that all their treaties for peace were carried on under the
eye of the French Court. This began to appear towards
the conclusion, when Mr Hartley refused going to Versailles,
to sign there with the other powers our definitive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
treaty, and insisted on its being done at Paris, which we
in good humor complied with, but at an earlier hour, that
we might have time to acquaint Count de Vergennes before
he was to sign with the Duke of Manchester.</p>

<p>The Dutch definitive treaty was not then ready, and the
British Court now insists on finishing it either at London
or the Hague. If, therefore, the commission to us, which
has been so long delayed, is still intended, perhaps it will
be well to instruct us to treat either here or at London,
as we may find most convenient.</p>

<p>The treaty may be conducted, even there, in concert
and in the confidence of communication with the Ministers
of our friends, whose advice may be of use to us.</p>

<p>With respect to the British Court, we should, I think, be
constantly upon our guard, and impress strongly upon our
minds, that though it has made peace with us, it is not in
truth reconciled either to us, or to its loss of us, but still
flatters itself with hopes, that some change in the affairs of
Europe, or some disunion among ourselves, may afford
them an opportunity of recovering their dominion, punishing
those who have most offended, and securing our future
dependence. It is easy to see by the general turn of the
ministerial newspapers, (light things, indeed, as straws and
feathers, but like them they show which way the wind
blows) and by the malignant improvement their Ministers
make, in all the foreign Courts, of every little accident or
dissension among us, the riot of a few soldiers at Philadelphia,
the resolves of some town meetings, the reluctance to
pay taxes, &amp;c. all which are exaggerated, to represent our
government as so many anarchies, of which the people
themselves are weary, and the Congress as having lost its
influence, being no longer respected. I say it is easy to see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
from this conduct, that they bear us no good will, and that
they wish the reality of what they are pleased to imagine.
They have, too, a numerous royal progeny to provide for,
some of whom are educated in the military line. In these
circumstances we cannot be too careful to preserve the
friendships we have acquired abroad, and the union we
have established at home, to secure our credit by a punctual
discharge of our obligations of every kind, and our
reputation by the wisdom of our councils; since we know
not how soon we may have a fresh occasion for friends, for
credit, and for reputation.</p>

<p>The extravagant misrepresentations of our political
state in foreign countries, made it appear necessary to give
them better information, which I thought could not be
more effectually and authentically done, than by publishing
a translation into French, now the most general language
in Europe, of the Book of Constitutions, which had been
printed by order of Congress. This I accordingly got
well done, and presented two copies handsomely bound to
every foreign Minister here, the one for himself, the other
more elegant for his Sovereign. It has been well taken,
and has afforded matter of surprise to many, who had conceived
mean ideas of the state of civilization in America, and
could not have expected so much political knowledge and
sagacity had existed in our wilderness. And from all parts
I have the satisfaction to hear, that our constitutions in
general are much admired. I am persuaded, that this
step will not only tend to promote the emigration to our
country of substantial people from all parts of Europe, by
the numerous copies I shall disperse, but will facilitate our
future treaties with foreign Courts, who could not before
know what kind of government and people they had to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
treat with. As, in doing this, I have endeavored to further
the apparent views of Congress in the first publication,
I hope it may be approved, and the expense allowed. I
send herewith one of the copies.</p>

<p>Our treaties with Denmark and Portugal remain unfinished,
for want of instructions respecting them from Congress,
and a commission empowering some Minister or
Ministers to conclude them. The Emperor of Morocco,
we understand, has expressed a disposition to make a
treaty of amity and commerce with the United States. A
Mr Montgomery, who is a merchant settled at Alicant, has
been, it seems, rather forward in proposing a negotiation,
without authority for so doing, and has embarrassed us a
little, as may be seen by some letters I enclose.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> Perhaps
it would be well for the Congress to send a message
to that Prince, expressing their respect and regard for him,
till such time as they may judge it convenient to appoint
an Ambassador in form, furnished with proper presents to
make a treaty with him. The other Barbary States, too,
seem to require consideration, if we propose to carry on
any trade in the Mediterranean, but whether the security
of that trade is of sufficient importance to be worth purchasing,
at the rate of the tributes usually exacted by those
piratical States, is a matter of doubt, on which I cannot at
present form a judgment.</p>

<p>I shall immediately proceed, in pursuance of the first
instruction, to take the proper steps for acquainting his Imperial
Majesty of Germany with the dispositions of Congress,
having some reason to believe the overture may be
acceptable. His Minister here is of late extremely civil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
to me, and we are on very good terms. I have likewise
an intimate friend at that Court.</p>

<p>With respect to other powers, it seems best not to make
advances at present, but to meet and encourage them when
made, which I shall not fail to do, as I have already done
those of Sweden, Denmark, and Portugal. Possibly
Hamburg, to whom I have forwarded the letter of Congress,
may send a Minister to America if they wish for a
treaty to conclude it there. They have no Minister here.</p>

<p>I have lately received a memorial from the Minister of
Denmark, respecting a ship of that nation, the Providentia,
taken by one of our privateers and carried into Boston. I
enclose a copy of it, and request to be furnished with
directions and informations for the answer. It may be
well to send me a copy of the proceedings in the Courts.
From a perusal of the papers communicated with it, I am
satisfied that the cargo was clearly British property.</p>

<p>We have hitherto entered into no engagements respecting
the armed neutrality, and, in obedience to the fifth instruction,
we shall take care to avoid them hereafter. The
treaty between this Court and the United States for regulating
the powers, privileges, &amp;c. of consuls, is at length
completed, and is transcribing in order to be signed. I
hope to transmit a copy by the next packet. I have received
the Congress ratification of the two money treaties,
which will be soon exchanged, when I shall send copies of
them with that of Sweden.</p>

<p>I have given, and shall continue to give, Captain Paul
Jones all the assistance in my power, towards recovering
the prize money; and I hope it may soon be accomplished.</p>

<p>When Mr Jay returns, I shall desire him to make the
inquiry directed in the fourth instruction, respecting the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
expedition under that Commodore, and report thereon to
Congress. In the meantime I can answer respecting one
of the questions, that the King paid the whole expense,
and that no part of it has ever been placed to the account
of Congress. There exists indeed a demand of one
Puchelberg, a person in the employ of M. Schweighauser,
of about thirty-thousand livres, for provisions and other
things furnished to Captain Landais, after he took the Alliance
out of the hands of Captain Jones; but as the ship
was at that time under the King's supply, who having borrowed
her for the expedition when fitted for sea, and just
ready to sail with Mr Adams, had ordered her to be delivered
in the same condition, free of all charges accrued, or
accruing, by her being in Holland and in L'Orient, and as
M. Puchelberg had not only no orders from me to furnish
Captain Landais, but acted contrary to my orders given
to M. Schweighauser, and contrary to the orders of M.
Schweighauser himself, I refused to pay his account, which
besides appeared extravagant, and it has never yet been
paid.</p>

<p>I shall do my best in executing the third instruction, respecting
our claim upon Denmark. I have written to London
to obtain if possible an account of the sums insured
upon the ships delivered up, as such an account may be
some guide in the valuation of the prizes.</p>

<p>A Captain Williams, formerly in the British service, and
employed upon the lakes, has given me a paper containing
information of the state of the back country. As those
informations may possibly be of some use, I send herewith
the paper. Mr Carmichael has sent me the accounts of
the money transactions at Madrid. As soon as Mr Jay returns
they will be examined.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>Be pleased to present my dutiful respects to Congress,
and assure them of my most faithful services.</p>

<p>With great esteem and regard I have the honor to
be, &amp;c.</p>

<h3>TO ROBERT MORRIS.</h3>

<p class="signature">
Passy, December 25th, 1783.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,
</p>

<p>The remissness of our people in paying taxes is highly
blameable, the unwillingness to pay them is still more so.
I see in some resolutions of town meetings, a remonstrance
against giving Congress a power to take, as they call it, <em>the
people's money</em> out of their pockets, though only to pay the
interest and principal of debts duly contracted. They
seem to mistake the point. Money justly due from the people
is their creditor's money, and no longer the money of
the people, who if they withhold it should be compelled to
pay by some law. All property indeed, except the savage's
temporary cabin, his bow, his matchuat, and other
little acquisitions absolutely necessary for his subsistence,
seems to me to be the creature of public convention.
Hence the public has the right of regulating descents, and
all other conveyances of property, and even of limiting the
quantity and uses of it. All the property that is necessary
to a man for the conservation of the individual, and the
propagation of the species, is his natural right, which none
can justly deprive him of; but all property superfluous to
such purposes is the property of the public, who by their
laws have created it, and who may therefore by other laws
dispose of it whenever the welfare of the public shall desire
such disposition. He that does not like civil society on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
these terms, let him retire and live among the savages.
He can have no right to the benefits of society, who will
not pay his club towards the support of it.</p>

<p>The Marquis de Lafayette, who loves to be employed
in our affairs, and is often very useful, has lately had
several conversations with the Ministers and persons concerned
in forming new regulations, respecting the commerce
between our two countries, which are not yet
concluded. I thought it therefore well to communicate
to him a copy of your letter, which contains so many sensible
and just observations on that subject. He will make
a proper use of them, and perhaps they may have more
weight, as appearing to come from a Frenchman, than they
would have if it were known, that they were the observations
of an American. I perfectly agree with you in all
the sentiments you have expressed on this occasion.</p>

<p>I am sorry for the public's sake, that you are about to
quit your office, but on personal considerations, I shall
congratulate you; for I cannot conceive of a more happy
man, than he who having been long loaded with public
cares finds himself relieved from them, and enjoying private
repose in the bosom of his friends and family.</p>

<p>With sincere regard and attachment, I am ever, dear
Sir, yours, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,
</p>

<p>If the Congress should think it fit to have a consul for
the United States in London, and do not appoint one of our
own countrymen to that office, I beg leave to mention the
merits of Mr William Hodgson, a merchant of that city,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
who has always been a zealous friend of America, was a
principal promoter of the subscription for the relief of
American prisoners, and chairman of the committee for
dispensing the money raised by that subscription. He also
took the trouble of applying the monies I furnished him
with, when the subscription was exhausted, and constantly
assisted me in all the negotiations I had with the British
Ministers, in their favor, wherein he generally succeeded,
being a man of weight and credit, very active, and much
esteemed for his probity and integrity. These his services,
continued steadily during the whole war, seem to entitle
him to the favorable notice of Congress, when any occasion
offers of doing him service or pleasure.</p>

<p>With great respect, I have the honor to be, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Will you be so good as to transmit the enclosed to Mr
Jay? I am sorry that we are going to lose him from this

arrive speedily, I might hope to have the pleasure of seeing
him again before his departure. As soon as I hear
from you of the arrival of your ratification I will immediately
apply for the despatch of the British ratification.
I wish very much to have the pleasure of conversing with
you again. In hopes that that time may come soon, I
have nothing further to say at present. Believe me always

Passy, March 9th, 1784.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,
</p>

<p>I received a few days since a letter from Annapolis,
dated June the 5th, in your hand writing, but not signed,
acquainting the Commissioners with the causes of delay
in sending the ratification of the Definitive Treaty. The
term was expired before that letter came to hand, but I
hope no difficulty will arise from a failure in a point not
essential, and which was occasioned by accidents. I have
just received from Mr Hartley a letter on the subject, of
which I enclose a copy.</p>

<p>We have had a terrible winter, too, here, such as the
oldest men do not remember, and indeed it has been very
severe all over Europe.</p>

<p>I have exchanged ratifications with the Ambassador of
Sweden, and enclose a copy of that I received from him.</p>

<p>Mr Jay is lately returned from England. Mr Laurens
is still there, but proposes departing for America next
month, as does also Mr Jay, with his family. Mr Adams
is in Holland, where he has been detained by business and
bad weather. These absences have occasioned some delays
in our business, but not of much importance.</p>

<p>The war long expected between the Turks and Russians
is prevented by a treaty, and it is thought an accommodation
will likewise take place between them and the
Emperor. Everything here continues friendly and favorable
to the United States. I am pestered continually with
numbers of letters from people in different parts of Europe,
who would go to settle in America, but who manifest very
extravagant expectations, such as I can by no means encourage,
and who appear otherwise to be very improper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
persons. To save myself trouble, I have just printed
some copies of the enclosed little piece, which I purpose
to send hereafter in answer to such letters.</p>

<h3>TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">
Passy, May 12th, 1784.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,</p>

<p>In my last I acquainted your Excellency, that Mr Hartley
was soon expected here to exchange ratifications of the
Definitive Treaty. He is now arrived, and proposes to
make the exchange this afternoon. I shall then be enabled
to send a copy. Enclosed is the new British Proclamation
respecting our trade with their Colonies. It is
said to be a temporary provision, till Parliament can assemble
and make some proper regulating law, or till a
commercial treaty shall be framed and agreed to. Mr
Hartley expects instructions for planning with us such a
treaty. The Ministry are supposed to have been too busy
with the new elections, when he left London, to think of
those matters.</p>

<p>This Court has not completed its intended new system
for the trade of their Colonies, so that I cannot yet give a
certain account of the advantages that will in fine be allowed
us. At present it is said we are to have two free ports,
Tobago and the Mole, and that we may carry lumber and
all sorts of provisions to the rest, except flour, which is
reserved in favor of Bordeaux, and that we shall be permitted
to export coffee, rum, molasses, and some sugar, for
our own consumption.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>We have had under consideration a commercial treaty
proposed to us by the King of Prussia, and have sent it
back with our remarks to Mr Adams, who will I suppose
transmit it immediately to Congress. Those planned with
Denmark and Portugal wait its determination,</p>

<h3>DAVID HARTLEY TO B. FRANKLIN.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">
Paris, June 1st, 1784.</p>

<p>Sir,
</p>

<p>I have the honor to inform you, that I have transmitted
to London the ratification on the part of Congress of the
Definitive Treaty of peace, between Great Britain and the
United States of America, and I am ordered to represent
to you, that a want of form appears in the first paragraph
of that instrument, wherein the United States are mentioned
before his Majesty, contrary to the established custom
in every treaty in which a crowned head and a republic
are parties. It is likewise to be observed, that the term
definitive <em>articles</em> is used instead of definitive <em>treaty</em>, and
the conclusion appears likewise deficient, as it is neither
signed by the President, nor is it dated, and consequently,
is wanting in some of the most essential points of form
necessary towards authenticating the validity of the instrument.</p>

<p>I am ordered to propose to you, Sir, that these defects<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
in the ratification should be corrected, which might very
easily be done, either by signing a declaration in the name
of Congress for preventing the particular mode of expression,
so far as it relates to precedency in the first paragraph,
being considered as a precedent to be adopted on
any future occasion, or else by having a new copy made
out in America, in which these mistakes should be corrected,
and which might be done without any prejudice
arising to either of the parties from the delay.</p>

<p>I am, Sir, with great respect and consideration, &amp;c.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<h3>TO DAVID HARTLEY.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">
Passy, June 2d, 1784.</p>
<p class="letter_open">
Sir,
</p>

<p>I have considered the observations you did me the honor
of communicating to me, concerning certain inaccuracies
of expression, and supposed defects of formality, in the instrument
of ratification, some of which are said to be of
such a nature as to affect the validity of the instrument.</p>

<p>The first is, "that the United States are named before
his Majesty, contrary to the established custom observed in
every treaty in which a crowned head and a republic are
the contracting parties." With respect to this, it seems to
me we should distinguish between that act in which both
join, to wit, the treaty, and that which is the act of each
separately, the ratification. It is necessary, that all the
modes of expression in the joint act should be agreed to
by both parties, though in their separate acts each party is
master of, and alone unaccountable for its own mode.
And, on inspecting the treaty, it will be found that his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
Majesty is always regularly named before the United
States. Thus, "the established custom <em>in treaties</em> between
crowned heads and republics," contended for on your part,
is strictly observed; and the ratification following the treaty
contains these words. "Now know ye, that we, the
United States in Congress assembled, having seen and
considered the definitive articles aforesaid, have <em>approved</em>,
<em>ratified</em>, and <em>confirmed</em>, and by these presents do <em>approve</em>,
<em>ratify</em>, and <em>confirm</em> the said articles, <small>AND EVERY PART AND
CLAUSE THEREOF</small>," &amp;c. Hereby all those articles, parts,
and clauses, wherein the King is named before the United
States, are <em>approved</em>, <em>ratified</em>, and <em>confirmed</em>, and this solemnly
under the signature of the President of Congress,
with the public seal affixed by their order, and countersigned
by their Secretary.</p>

<p>No declaration on the subject more determinate or more
authentic can possibly be made or given, which, when considered,
may probably induce his Majesty's Ministers to
waive the proposition of our signing a similar declaration,
or of sending back the ratification to be corrected in this
point, neither appearing to be really necessary. I will,
however, if it be still desired, transmit to Congress the observation,
and the difficulty occasioned by it, and request
their orders upon it. In the meantime I may venture to
say, that I am confident there was no intention of affronting
his Majesty by their order of nomination, but that it resulted
merely from that sort of complaisance, which every
nation seems to have for itself, and of that respect for its
own government, customarily so expressed in its own acts,
of which the English among the rest afford an instance,
when in the title of the King they always name Great Britain
before France.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>The second objection is, "that the term definitive <em>articles</em>
is used instead of definitive <em>treaty</em>" If the words <em>definitive
treaty</em> had been used in the ratification instead of <em>definitive
articles</em>, it might have been more correct, though the difference
seems not great nor of much importance, as in the
treaty itself it is called the present <em>Definitive Treaty</em>.</p>

<p>The other objections are, "that the conclusion likewise
appears deficient, as if is neither signed by the President,
nor is it dated, and consequently is wanting in some of the
most essential points of form necessary towards authenticating
the validity of the instrument." The situation of
seals and signatures, in public instruments, differs in different
countries, though all equally valid; for when all the
parts of an instrument are connected by a ribband, whose
ends are secured under the impression of the seal, the
signature and seal wherever placed are understood as relating
to and authenticating the whole. Our usage is, to
place them both together in the broad margin near the
beginning of the piece, and so they stand in the present
ratification, the concluding words of which declare the
intention of such signing and sealing to be giving authenticity
to the whole instrument, viz. "<em>In testimony</em> whereof,
We have <em>caused</em> the seal of the United States to be hereunto
affixed; Witness his Excellency Thomas Mifflin, Esquire,
President;" and the date supposed to be omitted,
perhaps from its not appearing in figures, is nevertheless
to be found written in words at length, viz. "this fourteenth
day of January, in the year of our Lord one thousand
seven hundred eightyfour," which made the figures unnecessary.</p>

<p>With great esteem and respect, I have the honor to be,

<h3>TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">
Passy, June 16th, 1784.</p>
<p class="letter_open">
Sir,
</p>

<p>My letter by Mr Jay acquainted your Excellency, that
the ratifications of the Definitive Treaty were exchanged.
A copy of the British part was also sent by him.</p>

<p>Mr Hartley remained here expecting instructions to
treat with us on the subject of commerce. The bustle attending
a new election and meeting of Parliament, he
imagined might occasion the long delay of those instructions.
He now thinks that the affair of the American
trade, being under the consideration of Parliament, it is
probable no treaty will be proposed till the result is
known. Mr Jay, who sailed for America the first instant
from Dover, and who saw there several of our friends
from London before his departure, and Mr Laurens who
left London the 6th to go on in the Falmouth packet,
will be able to give you more perfect informations than
I can, of what may be expected as the determination of
the British government respecting our intercourse with
their Islands; and, therefore, I omit my conjectures, only
mentioning, that from various circumstances there seems
to be some lurking remains of ill humor there, and of
resentment against us, which only wants a favorable opportunity
to manifest itself.</p>

<p>This makes it more necessary for us to be upon our
guard, and prepared for events, that a change in the
affairs of Europe may produce; its tranquillity depending,
perhaps, on the life of one man, and it being impossible
to foresee in what situation a new arrangement of its
various interests may place us. Ours will be respected in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
proportion to the apparent solidity of our government, the
support of our credit, the maintenance of a good understanding
with our friends, and our readiness for defence.
All which I persuade myself will be taken care of.</p>

<p>Enclosed I send a copy of a letter from Mr Hartley to
me, respecting some supposed defects in the ratification,
together with my answer, which he has transmitted to
London. The objections appeared to me trivial and
absurd, but I thought it prudent to treat them with as
much decency as I could, lest the ill temper should be
augmented, which might be particularly inconvenient, while
the commerce was under consideration. There has not
yet been time for Mr Hartley to hear whether my answer
has been satisfactory, or whether the Ministers will still
insist on my sending for an amended copy from America,
as they proposed.</p>

<p>I do not perceive the least diminution in the good disposition
of this Court towards us, and I hope care will be
taken to preserve it.</p>

<p>The Marquis de Lafayette, who will have the honor of
delivering this to you, has, ever since his arrival in Europe,
been very industrious in his endeavors to serve us
and promote our interests, and has been of great use on
several occasions. I should wish the Congress might
think fit to express in some proper manner their sense of
his merit.</p>

<p>My malady prevents my going to Versailles, as I cannot
bear a carriage upon pavement, but my grandson goes
regularly on Court days to supply my place, and is well
received there. The last letters I have had the honor of
receiving from you, are of the 14th of January.</p>

<h3>CONSULAR CONVENTION.</h3>

<p>Convention between His Most Christian Majesty and
the Thirteen United States of North America, for the purpose
of determining and fixing the functions and prerogatives
of their respective consuls, vice consuls, agents, and
commissaries.</p>

<p>His Majesty, The Most Christian King, and the Thirteen
United States of North America, having, by the 29th
article of the Treaty of Amity and Commerce concluded
between them, mutually granted the liberty of having in
their respective States and ports, consuls, vice consuls,
agents, and commissaries, and being willing in
consequence thereof, to determine and fix in a reciprocal and
permanent manner the functions and prerogatives of the
said consuls, vice consuls, agents, and commissaries, His
Most Christian Majesty has nominated the Sieur Charles
Gravier, Count of Vergennes, Baron of Welfording, &amp;c.
Counsellor of the King in all his Councils, Commander of
his Orders, Head of the Royal Council of Finances, Counsellor
of the State of the Sword, Minister and Secretary of
State, and of his Commands and Finances; and the
United States, Mr Benjamin Franklin, their Minister
Plenipotentiary to His Most Christian Majesty, who, after
having communicated to each other their respective full
powers, agreed upon what follows.</p>


<h4>ARTICLE I.</h4>

<p>The consuls and vice consuls, nominated by His Most
Christian Majesty and the United States, shall be bound to
present their commissions on their arrival in their respective
States, according to the form which shall be there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
established. There shall be delivered to them without
any charges the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Exequatur</i> necessary for the exercise of
their functions; and, on the exhibition they shall make of
the said Exequatur, the governors, commanders, heads of
justice, public bodies, tribunals, and other officers, having
authority in the ports and places of their consulates, shall
cause them to enjoy, as soon as possible, and without difficulty,
the pre-eminences, authority, and privileges, reciprocally
granted, without exacting from said consuls and vice
consuls, any duty under any pretext whatever.</p>


<h4>ARTICLE II.</h4>

<p>The respective consuls shall have power to establish
vice consuls in the different ports and places of their departments,
where necessity shall require. There shall be
delivered to them likewise the Exequatur necessary to the
exercise of their functions, in the form pointed out in the
preceding article, and on the exhibition, which they shall
make of the said Exequatur, they shall be admitted and
acknowledged in the terms and according to the powers,
authority, and privileges, stipulated by the 1st, 4th and
5th articles of the present convention.</p>


<h4>ARTICLE III.</h4>

<p>The respective consuls and vice consuls may establish
agents in the different ports and places of their departments,
where necessity shall require; these agents may be
chosen among the merchants, either national or foreign,
and furnished with a commission from one of the said
consuls. It shall be their business, respectively, to render
to their respective merchants, navigators, and vessels, all
possible service, and to inform the nearest consul or vice
consul of the wants of the said merchants, navigators, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
vessels, without the said agents otherwise participating in
the immunities, rights, and privileges, attributed to the
consuls and vice consuls, and without power to exact from
the said merchants any duty or emolument whatever,
under any pretext whatever.</p>


<h4>ARTICLE IV.</h4>

<p>The consuls and vice consuls, officers of the consulate,
and in general, all persons attached to the consular functions,
shall enjoy respectively a full and entire immunity
for their persons, their papers, and their houses. The list
of the said persons shall be approved and inspected by the
executive power of the place of their residence.</p>

<p>They shall be exempt from all personal service and public
offices, from soldier's billets, militia, watch guard, guardianship
and trusteeship, as well as from all duties, taxes,
impositions, and charges whatsoever, except the real estates
of which they may be proprietors, which shall be subject
to the taxes imposed on the estates of all other individuals.</p>

<p>They shall place over the outward door of their house
the arms of their sovereign, without this mark of distinction
giving to the said house the right of asylum for any malefactor
or criminal, so that in case it should happen that any
malefactor or criminal take refuge there, he shall be instantly
delivered up on the first requisition, and without
difficulty.</p>


<h4>ARTICLE V.</h4>

<p>Generally, in all cases whatever, which concern the police
or administration of justice, where it may be necessary
to have a juridical declaration from the said consuls and
vice consuls respectively, the governors, commandants,
chief justice, public bodies, tribunals, or other officers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
whatever of their respective residence there, having authority,
shall be bound to inform them of it, by writing to
them, or sending to them a military or civil officer to let
them know, either the object which is proposed, or the
necessity there is for going to them to demand from them
this declaration, and the said consuls end vice consuls
shall be bound on their part to comply faithfully with what
shall be desired of them on these occasions.</p>


<h4>ARTICLE VI.</h4>

<p>The consuls and vice consuls respectively may establish
a chancery, where shall be deposited the consular acts
and deliberations, all effects left by deceased persons, or
saved from shipwreck, as well as testaments, obligations,
contracts, and, in general, all the acts and proceedings
done between, or by, persons of their nations.</p>

<p>They may, in consequence, appoint for the <em>business</em> of
the said chancery capable persons, receive them, administer
an oath to them, give to them the keeping of the seal,
and the right of seal, commissions, judgments, and other
acts of the consulate, as well as there to discharge the
functions of notaries and registers.</p>


<h4>ARTICLE VII.</h4>

<p>The consuls and vice consuls respectively shall have
the exclusive right of receiving in their chancery, or on
board of vessels, the declarations and all other acts, which
the captains, masters, seamen, passengers, and merchants
of their nation would make there, even their testaments and
other dispositions of last will, and the copies of the said
acts duly authenticated by the said consuls, or vice consuls,
and under the seal of their consulate shall receive faith in
law in all the tribunals of France and the United States.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>They shall have also, and exclusively, the right to inventory,
liquidate, and proceed to the sale of the moveable
effects of the estates left by subjects of their nation who
shall die within the extent of the consulate. They shall
proceed therein with the assistance of two merchants of
their said nation, of their own choosing, and shall deposit
in their chancery the effects and papers of the said estates,
and no officer, military or civil, or of the police of the
country, shall trouble them or interfere therein, in any
manner whatsoever; but the said consuls and vice consuls
shall not deliver up the same and their product to the
lawful heirs, or <em>their attornies</em>, until they shall have discharged
all the debts, which the deceased shall have contracted
in the country, by judgment, by acts, or by notes,
the writing and signing of which shall be known and certified
by two principal merchants of the nation of the said
deceased, and in all other cases the payment of debts cannot
be ordered but on the creditor's giving sufficient and
local security to repay the sums unduly received, principal,
interest, and costs, which securities, however, shall remain
duly discharged after a year in time of peace, and two
years in time of war, if the demand in discharge cannot be
formed before these delays, against the heirs who shall
present themselves.</p>


<h4>ARTICLE VIII.</h4>

<p>The respective consuls and vice consuls shall receive
the declarations, "<em>consulats</em>," and other consular acts from
all captains and masters of their respective nations on account
of average losses sustained at sea by leakage, or
throwing merchandises overboard, and these captains and
masters shall leave in the chancery of the said consuls and
vice consuls, the "consulats," and other consular acts,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
which they may have had made in other ports on account
of the accidents, that may have happened to them on their
voyage. If a subject of His Most Christian Majesty and
a citizen of the United States are interested in the said
cargo, the average shall be fixed by the tribunals of the
country, and not by the consuls or vice consuls; and
the tribunals shall admit the acts and declarations; if any
should have been passed before the said consuls and vice
consuls; but when only the subjects of their own nation,
or foreigners, shall be interested, the respective consuls or
vice consuls, and in case of their absence or distance,
their agents furnished with their commission, shall officially
nominate skilful persons of their said nation to regulate
the damages and averages.</p>


<h4>ARTICLE IX.</h4>

<p>In case, by storms or other accidents, French ships or
vessels shall run ashore on the coasts of the United States,
or the ships and vessels of the United States shall run
ashore on the coasts of France, the consul or vice consul
nearest to the place of shipwreck shall do whatever he
may judge proper, as well for the purpose of saving the
said ship or vessel, its cargo and appurtenances, as for the
storing and security of the effects and merchandise saved.
He may take an inventory, without any officers military, of
the custom house, justices, or the police of the country
interfering, otherwise than to facilitate to the consuls, vice
consuls, captain and crew of the vessel shipwrecked, or
run ashore, all the assistance and favor, which they shall
ask, either for the celerity and security of the salvage and
effects saved, or to prevent all disturbances.</p>

<p>To prevent even any kind of dispute and discussion in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
the said cases of shipwreck, it has been agreed that where
no consul or vice consul shall be found to attend to the
salvage, or that the residence of the said consul or vice
consul, (he not being at the place of shipwreck) shall be
further distant from the said place than that of the competent
territorial judge, the latter shall immediately there proceed
therein with all the celerity, safety, and precautions
prescribed by the respective laws; but the said territorial
judge shall retire on the coming of the consul or vice consul,
and shall resign to him the procedures by him done,
the expenses of which the consul or vice consul shall cause
to be reimbursed to him.</p>

<p>The merchandise and effects saved shall be deposited
in the custom house, or other nearest place of safety, with
the inventory of them, which shall be made by the consul
or vice consul, or in their absence by the judge who shall
have had cognizance thereof, and the said merchandises and
effects shall be afterwards delivered, after levying therefrom
the costs, and without form of process to the proprietors,
who being furnished with a <em>replevy</em> from the nearest
consul or vice consul, shall reclaim them by themselves,
or their attornies, either for the purpose of re-exporting
the merchandises, and in that case they shall pay no kind
of duties of exportation, or for the purpose of selling them
in the country if they are not prohibited; and in this latter
case, the said merchandises being averaged, there shall be
granted them an abatement of the entrance duties proportioned
to the damages sustained, which shall be ascertained
by the <em>verbal process</em> formed at the time of the shipwreck,
or of the vessels running ashore.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>


<h4>ARTICLE X.</h4>

<p>The consuls and vice consuls shall have, on board of the
vessels of their respective nations, full power and jurisdiction
in matters civil. They shall cause to be executed
the respective laws, ordinances, and rules concerning navigation,
on board the said vessels, and for this purpose, they
shall go there without being interrupted by any officer or
other person whatsoever.</p>

<p>They may cause to be arrested every vessel carrying the
flag of their respective nation. They may sequester
them, and even send them back respectively, from the
United States to France, or from France to the United
States. They may cause to be arrested without difficulty,
every captain, master, sailor, or passenger of their said respective
nation.</p>

<p>They may cause to be arrested or detained in the
country the sailors and deserters of their respective nations,
or send them back, or transport them out of the country.</p>

<p>It shall be sufficient proof, that the sailors and deserters
belong to one of the respective nations, that their names
be written in the ships' registers, or inserted in the roll of
the crew.</p>

<p>One and the other of these proofs concerning sailors
and deserters being thus given, no tribunals, judges, and
officers whatsoever shall in any manner whatever take cognizance
of the complaints, which the said sailors and deserters
may make, but they shall, on the contrary, be
delivered up on an order signed by the consul, or vice
consul, without its being in any one's power in any manner

<h3>TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">

<p class="letter_open">Sir,
</p>

<p>I received by the Marquis de Lafayette the two letters
you did me the honor of writing to me the 11th and 14th
of December, the one enclosing a letter from Congress to
the King, the other a resolve of Congress respecting the
convention for establishing consuls. The letter was immediately
delivered and well received. The resolve came
too late to suspend signing the convention, it having been
done July last, and a copy sent so long since, that we now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
expected the ratification. As that copy seems to have
miscarried I now send another.</p>

<p>I am not informed what objection has arisen in Congress
to the plan sent me. Mr Jefferson thinks it may
have been to the part, which restrained the consuls from all
concern in commerce. That article was omitted, being
thought unnecessary to be stipulated, since either party
would always have the power of imposing such restraints
on its own officers, whenever it should think fit. I am,
however, of opinion that this or any other reasonable article
or alteration may be obtained at the desire of Congress,
and established by a supplement.</p>

<p>Permit me, Sir, to congratulate you on your being called
to the high honor of presiding in our national councils, and
to wish you every felicity, being with the most perfect
esteem, &amp;c.</p>

<h3>TO THOMAS BARCLAY.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">
Passy, June 19th, 1785.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,
</p>

<p>With respect to my continuing to charge ¬£2500 sterling
per annum as my salary, of which you desire some explanation,
I send you, in support of that charge, the resolution
of Congress, which is in these words.</p>

<p>"In Congress, October 5th, 1779. Resolved, that each
of the Ministers Plenipotentiary be allowed at the rate of
two thousand five hundred pounds sterling per annum, and
each of their Secretaries at the rate of one thousand
pounds sterling per annum, in full for their services and
expenses respectively. That the salary of each of the
said officers be computed from the time of his leaving his
place of abode, to enter on the duties of his office, and be
continued three months after the notice of his recall."</p>

<p>The several bills I afterwards received, drawn on the
Congress banker, Mr Grand, for my salary, were all calculated
on that sum, as my salary; and neither the banker
nor myself has received notice of any change respecting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
me. He has accordingly, since the drawing ceased, continued
to pay me at the same rate. I have, indeed, heard
that a resolution was passed last year, that the salaries of
Plenipotentiaries should be no more than ¬£2000 sterling
per annum. But the resolution, I suppose, can relate only
to such Plenipotentiaries as should be afterwards appointed;
for I cannot conceive that the Congress, after
promising a Minister ¬£2500 a year, and when he has
thereby been encouraged to engage in a way of living for
their honor, which only that salary can support, would
think it just to diminish it a fifth, and leave him under the
difficulty of reducing his expenses proportionably; a thing
scarce practicable; the necessity of which he might have
avoided, if he had not confided in their original promise.</p>

<p>But the article of salary, with all the rest of my accounts,
will be submitted to the judgment of Congress,
together with some other considerable articles I have not
charged, but on which I shall expect, from their equity,
some consideration. If, for want of knowing precisely the
intention of Congress, what expenses should be deemed
public, and what private, I have charged any article to
the public, which should be defrayed by me, their
banker has my order, as soon as the pleasure of Congress
shall be made known to him, to rectify the error, by transferring
the amount to my private account, and discharging
by so much that of the public.</p>

<p>
I have the honor to be, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,

<p>I have the honor to acquaint you, that I left Paris the
12th of July, and, agreeable to the permission of Congress,
am returned to my own country. Mr Jefferson had recovered
his health, and was much esteemed and respected
there. Our joint letters have already informed you of our
late proceedings, to which I have nothing to add, except
that the last act I did, as Minister Plenipotentiary for
making treaties, was to sign with him, two days before I
came away, the treaty of friendship and commerce that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
had been agreed on with Prussia,<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> and which was to be
carried to the Hague, by Mr Short, there to be signed by
Baron Thulemeyer on the part of the King, who, without
the least hesitation, had approved and conceded to the new
humane articles proposed by Congress. Mr Short was
also to call at London for the signature of Mr Adams,
who I learnt, when at Southampton, was well received at
the British Court.</p>

<p>The Captain Lamb, who, in a letter of yours to Mr
Adams, was said to be coming to us with instructions respecting
Morocco, had not appeared, nor had we heard
anything of him; so nothing had been done by us in that
treaty.</p>

<p>I left the Court of France in the same friendly disposition
towards the United States, that we have all along experienced,
though concerned to find that our credit is not
better supported in the payment of the interest money due
on our loans, which, in case of another war, must be,
they think, extremely prejudicial to us, and indeed may
contribute to draw on a war the sooner, by affording our
enemies the encouraging confidence, that those who take
so little care to pay, will not again find it easy to borrow.
I received from the King, at my departure, the
present of his picture set round with diamonds, usually
given to Ministers Plenipotentiary, who have signed any
treaties with that Court; and it is at the disposition of
Congress, to whom be pleased to present my dutiful
respects.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,
</p>

<p>I send you enclosed some letters, that have passed between
the Secretary of Congress and me, respecting three
millions of livres, acknowledged to have been received, before
the treaty of February, 1778, as <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">don gratuit</i> from the
King, of which only two millions are found in your accounts;
unless the million from the Farmers-General be
one of the three. I have been assured, that all the money
received from the King, whether as loan or gift, went
through your hands; and as I always looked on the million
we had of the Farmers-General to be distinct from
what we had of the Crown, I wonder how I came to sign
the contract, acknowledging three millions of gift, when,
in reality, there was only two, exclusive of that from the
Farmers; and, as both you and I examined the project
of the contract before I signed it, I am surprised, that
neither of us took notice of the error.</p>

<p>It is possible, that the million furnished ostensibly by the
Farmers, was in fact a gift of the Crown, in which case,
as Mr Thompson observes, they owe us for the two ship
loads of tobacco, which they received on account of it. I
must earnestly request of you to get this matter explained,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
that it may stand clear before I die, lest some enemy
should afterwards accuse me of having received a million
not accounted for.</p>

<p class="letter_open">
Sir,
</p>

<p>I have received the letter, which you did me the honor
to write on the 28th of this month, touching the advance of
a million, which you say was made by the Farmers-General
to the United States of America, the 3d of June,
1777. I have no knowledge of that advance. What
I have verified is, that the King, by the contract of the
25th of February, 1783, has confirmed the gratuitous gift,
which his Majesty had previously made, of the three millions
hereafter mentioned, viz. one million delivered by
the Royal Treasury, the 10th of June, 1776, and two
other millions advanced also by the Royal Treasury, in
1777, on four receipts of the Deputies of Congress, of the
17th of January, 3d of April, 10th of June, and 15th of
October, of the same year. This explanation will, Sir, I
hope, resolve your doubt, touching the advance of the 3d
of June, 1777. I further recommend to you, Sir, to
confer on this subject with M. Gojard, who ought to be
better informed than we, who had no knowledge of any
advances, but those made by the Royal Treasury.</p>

<p>I laid before the Count de Vergennes the two letters,
which you did me the honor to write, touching the three
millions, the free gift of which the King has confirmed in
favor of the United States of America. The Minister,
Sir, observed that this gift has nothing to do with the million,
which the Congress may have received from the

the receipt, which you desire may be communicated to

<p class="letter_open">
My Dear Sir,
</p>

<p>The letter you honored me with, covered the copies of
three letters, which Mr Thompson wrote you to obtain an
explanation of a million, which is not to be found in my
accounts. I should have been very much embarrassed in
satisfying and proving to him, that I had not put that million
in my pocket, had I not applied to M. Durival, who, as
you will see by the answer enclosed, informs me, that there
was a million paid by the Royal Treasury, on the 10th of
June, 1776. This is the very million about which Mr Thompson
inquires, as I have kept an account of the
other two millions, which were also furnished by the Royal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
Treasury, viz. the one million in January and April, 1777,
the other in July and October of the same year, as well
as that furnished by the Farmers-General in June, 1777.</p>

<p>Here then are the three millions exactly, which were
given by the King before the treaty of 1778, and that
furnished by the Farmers-General. Nothing then remains
to be known, but who received the first million in June,
1776. It could not be myself, as I was not charged with
the business of Congress until January, 1777. I therefore
requested of M. Durival a copy of the receipt for the one
million. You have the answer, which he returned to me.
I wrote to him again, renewing my request, but as the
courier is just setting off, I cannot wait to give you his
answer, but you will receive it in my next, if I obtain
one.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile, I beg you will receive the assurances
of the sentiments of respect, with which I have the honor
to be, my dear Sir, &amp;c.</p>

<p>I have laid before the Count de Vergennes, as you

to write yesterday. The Minister persists in the opinion,
that the receipt, the copy of which you request, has no

the new point of view in which you have placed it. Indeed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
Sir, it is easy for you to prove, that the money in

I cannot conceive the reason for this reserve, more especially

<h3>TO CHARLES THOMPSON.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">
Philadelphia, January 27th, 1787.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Dear Friend,
</p>

<p>You may remember, that in the correspondence between
us in June last, on the subject of a million <em>free gift</em> of the
King of France, acknowledged in our contract to have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
received, but which did not appear to be accounted for in
our banker's accounts, unless it should be the same with
the million said to be received from the Farmers-General,
I mentioned, that an explanation might doubtless be easily
obtained by writing to Mr Grand, or Mr Jefferson. I know
not whether you have accordingly written to either of them,
but being desirous that the matter should speedily be cleared
up, I wrote myself to Mr Grand a letter upon it, of which
I now enclose a copy, with his answers, and several letters
from M. Durival,<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> who is <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chef du Bureau des Fonds</i> (and
has under his care the finance) <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">des Affaires Etrangeres</i>.</p>

<p>You will see by these letters, that the million in question
was delivered to somebody, on the 10th of June, 1776,
but it does not appear to whom. It is clear, however, that
it could not be to Mr Grand, nor to the Commissioners from
Congress, for we did not meet in France till the end of
December, 1776, or beginning of January, 1777, and that
banker was not charged before with our affairs.</p>

<p>By the Minister's reserve in refusing him a copy of the
receipt, I conjecture it must be money advanced for our use,
to M. de Beaumarchais, and that it is a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Myst√®re du Cabinet</i>,
which perhaps should not be further inquired into, unless
necessary to guard against more demands than may be
just from that agent; for it may well be supposed, that if
the Court furnished him with the means of supplying us,
they may not be willing to furnish authentic proofs of such a
transaction, so early in our dispute with Britain. Pray tell
me, has he dropped his demands, or does he still continue
to worry you with them?</p>

<p>I should like to have these original letters returned to
me, but you may if you please keep copies of them. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
true the million in question makes no difference in your
accounts with the King of France, it not being mentioned
or charged, as so much lent and to be repaid, but stated as
freely given. Yet, if it was put into the hands of any of
your agents, or ministers, they ought certainly to account
for it. I do not recollect whether Mr Deane had arrived
in France before the 10th of June, 1776;<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> but from his
great want of money, when I joined him a few months
after, I hardly think it could have been paid to him. Possibly
Mr Jefferson may obtain the information, though Mr
Grand could not, and I wish he may be directed to make
the inquiry, as I know he would do it directly; I mean if,
by Hortalez and Co's further demands, or for any other
reason, such an inquiry should be thought necessary.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<h3>TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">
Philadelphia, November 29th, 1788.</p>
<p class="letter_open">Sir,
</p>

<p>When I had the honor of being the Minister of the
United States at the Court of France, Mr Barclay arriving
there, brought me the following resolution of Congress.</p>

<p>"Resolved, that a commissioner be appointed by Congress,
with full power and authority to liquidate, and <em>finally
to settle</em>, the accounts of all the servants of the United<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
States, who have been intrusted with the expenditure of
public money in Europe, and to commence and prosecute
such suits, causes, and actions, as may be necessary for
that purpose, or for the recovery of any property of the
said United States in the hands of any person, or persons,
whatsoever.</p>

<p>"That the said commissioner be authorised to appoint
one or more clerks, with such allowance as he may think
reasonable.</p>

<p>"That the said commissioner and clerks, respectively,
take an oath before some person duly authorised to administer
an oath, faithfully to execute the trust reposed in
them respectively.</p>

<p>"Congress proceeded to the election of a commissioner,
and ballots being taken, Mr T. Barclay was elected."</p>

<p>In pursuance of this resolution, and as soon as Mr Barclay
was at leisure from more pressing business, I rendered
to him all my accounts, which he examined, and stated methodically.
By his statement he found a balance due me
on the 4th of May, 1785, of 7,533 livres, 19 sols, 3 den.
which I accordingly received of the Congress banker;
the difference between my statement and his being only
seven sols, which by mistake I had overcharged; about
three pence halfpenny sterling.</p>

<p>At my request, however, the accounts were left open for
the consideration of Congress, and not finally settled, there
being some articles on which I desired their judgment, and
having some equitable demands, as I thought them, for extra
services, which he had not conceived himself empowered
to allow, and therefore I did not put them in my
account. He transmitted the accounts to Congress, and
had advice of their being received. On my arrival at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
Philadelphia, one of the first things I did was to despatch
my grandson, William T. Franklin, to New York, to obtain
a final settlement of those accounts; he having long acted
as my secretary, and being well acquainted with the transactions,
was able to give an explanation of the articles, that
might seem to require explaining, if any such there were.
He returned without effecting the settlement, being told
that it could not be made till the arrival of some documents
expected from France. What those documents
were, I have not been informed, nor can I readily conceive,
as all the vouchers existing there had been examined by
Mr Barclay. And I, having been immediately after my
arrival engaged in the public business of this State, waited
in expectation of hearing from Congress, in case any part
of my accounts had been objected to.</p>

<p>It is now more than three years that those accounts
have been before that honorable body, and, to this day, no
notice of any such objection has been communicated to
me. But reports have, for some time past, been circulated
here, and propagated in the newspapers, that I am
greatly indebted to the United States for large sums, that
had been put into my hands, and that I avoid a settlement.
This, together with the little time one of my age may expect
to live, makes it necessary for me to request earnestly,
which I hereby do, that the Congress would be
pleased, without further delay, to examine those accounts,
and if they find therein any article or articles, which they
do not understand or approve, that they would cause me
to be acquainted with the same, that I may have an opportunity
of offering such explanations or reasons in support
of them as may be in my power, and then that the
accounts may be finally closed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>I hope the Congress will soon be able to attend to this
business for the satisfaction of the public, as well as in condescension
to my request. In the meantime, if there be
no impropriety in it, I would desire that this letter, together
with another<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> relating to the same subject, the
copy of which is hereto annexed, may be put upon their
minutes.</p>

<p>With every sentiment of respect and duty to Congress,
I am, Sir, &amp;c.</p>

<br />
CORRESPONDENCE<br />
<br />
<small>OF</small><br />
<br />
JOHN ADAMS,</h1>

<p class="center">ONE OF THE COMMISSIONERS TO FRANCE, MINISTER<br />
PLENIPOTENTIARY TO HOLLAND, AND ONE OF THE<br />
COMMISSIONERS FOR NEGOTIATING THE<br />
TREATY OF PEACE</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">&nbsp;</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">&nbsp;</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p><span class="smcap">John Adams</span> was a delegate in the first Continental
Congress, and one of the most active, zealous, and efficient
members of that body. For three years his labors
in Congress were incessant, and of the most valuable kind.
It is said of him, that he belonged to more committees than
any other individual, and he discharged the duties of each
with remarkable promptness and energy.</p>

<p>The foreign affairs of the United States having assumed
an important aspect, Mr Adams was appointed a Commissioner
to France in the place of Silas Deane, who had
been recalled. This appointment took place on the 28th
of November, 1777, and in the following February he embarked
from Boston. After a long and disagreeable passage
of fortyfive days he arrived in France. Here he devoted
himself to the duties of his mission, in conjunction
with his colleagues, till Dr Franklin was appointed Minister
Plenipotentiary to the Court of France, and the commission
was dissolved. Having no longer any charge to
execute in Europe, Mr Adams left Paris on the 8th of
March, 1779, for Nantes, where he proposed to embark
for his own country. Various accidents and unexpected
causes of delay kept him there till the 14th of June, when
he sailed in the French frigate, the Sensible, in company
with M. de la Luzerne, who was coming to the United
States in the character of Minister Plenipotentiary, as successor
to M. Gerard. The French government had voluntarily
proffered to Mr Adams a passage in this vessel,
after his disappointment in not sailing in the American<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
frigate Alliance, as he at first expected. The Sensible
arrived in Boston on the 3d of August.</p>

<p>But he was not long allowed to remain a spectator only
of public events. On the 27th of September he was again
chosen by Congress to represent his country abroad, as
Minister Plenipotentiary for negotiating a treaty of peace
and a treaty of commerce with Great Britain, when that
nation should be found in a humor to recognise the independence
of the United States, and enter into bonds of
friendship. A task more honorable, momentous, and difficult
could not have awaited him, nor one bearing more
emphatical testimony of the confidence of his countrymen
in his wisdom, abilities, integrity, and patriotism. On this
second mission he sailed in the same frigate, which had
brought him from France; accommodations for this purpose
having been offered to Congress by the French Minister
in Philadelphia. The vessel sprang a leak on the
passage, and the captain was obliged to put into Ferrol, in
Spain, where he arrived on the 8th of December. From
this place, that he might avoid further hazards and uncertainty
of a sea voyage in the depth of winter, Mr Adams
resolved to proceed by land to the point of his destination.
He reached Paris on the 9th of February, 1780. The
extreme badness of the travelling at this season had detained
him nearly two months on the road.</p>

<p>By the terms of his commission, the place of his residence
was not prescribed, but for the present he chose to
fix himself in Paris, as amicable relations already subsisted
between the French Court and Congress, and he was instructed
to consult the French Ministry in regard to any
movements, that might be made in effecting a treaty with
England. He held a correspondence with Count de Vergennes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
respecting the time and manner of carrying his
instructions into execution, and on other topics; in all of
which, however, his opinions and those of the French Minister
were somewhat at variance. There seeming no prospect
that Great Britain would soon be inclined to peace,
and Mr Adams having no special reasons for remaining at
the French Court, he made a tour to Holland in the beginning
of August, leaving his Secretary, Mr Dana, in Paris.</p>

<p>Meantime Congress had assigned to him another duty.
Mr Henry Laurens had been appointed, as early as November,
1779, to negotiate a loan of ten millions abroad,
but having been prevented by various causes from departing
on this service, Congress, on the 20th of June following,
authorised Mr Adams to engage in the undertaking,
and prosecute it till Mr Laurens, or some other person in
his stead, should arrive in Europe. This commission
reached Paris four weeks after he had left that city, and
Mr Dana proceeded with it to Holland. Efforts were immediately
made to procure a loan in that country, which
were for a long time ineffectual, but which at last succeeded.</p>

<p>Mr Laurens sailed for Holland in August, 1780, but was
captured a few days afterwards by a British frigate, which
conveyed him to Newfoundland, whence he was sent to
England and imprisoned in the Tower. When this intelligence
reached Congress, it was resolved to transfer his
appointment to another person, and on the 29th of December
Mr Adams was commissioned to negotiate a treaty of
amity and commerce with the United Provinces, and he
was furnished with separate letters of credence as Minister
Plenipotentiary to the States-General and to the Prince of
Orange. The state of parties in Holland, and particularly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
the influence of England there, rendered unavailing all
advances of the American Minister towards a treaty.</p>

<p>It having been intimated to Mr Adams, by the Duc de
la Vauguyon, French Ambassador in Holland, that a treaty
of peace was in prospect through the mediation of Russia
and Austria, and that Count de Vergennes would be glad
to see him on the subject at Versailles, he set off for Paris
on the 6th of July, 1781. He had several interviews
with the Count de Vergennes, and a correspondence of
some length. After remaining three weeks at Paris and
Versailles, without perceiving any apparent indications,
that this project for a negotiation would come to maturity,
he returned again to Holland.</p>

<p>On the 14th of June Congress appointed four other
Commissioners, in conjunction with Mr Adams, to negotiate
a treaty of peace, namely, Benjamin Franklin, John
Jay, Henry Laurens, and Thomas Jefferson, and the first
commission of Mr Adams for this purpose was annulled.</p>

<p>A misunderstanding having grown up between England
and the United Provinces, chiefly on account of the part
taken by the latter in joining the northern powers to carry
into operation the plan of the armed neutrality, the French
Court thought it a good opportunity for the United States
to seek a treaty of alliance with Holland. This step was
accordingly recommended to Congress through the French
Minister at Philadelphia, and, in consequence of this suggestion,
new powers were conferred on Mr Adams, dated
August the 16th, by which he was commissioned to negotiate
a treaty of alliance with Holland, limited in duration
to the continuance of the war with England, and conformable
to the treaties then subsisting with France.</p>

<p>The political relations between the several Provinces of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
Holland were such, however, that the process of negotiation
went on heavily and slowly. The English interest
still continued strong, even after the war had begun, and
embarrassments of various kinds were thrown in the way,
which required no common share of sagacity, firmness, and
perseverance to overcome. All these at length yielded,
and on the 8th of October, 1782, a treaty of commerce
between the United States and Holland, and a convention
concerning recaptures, were signed at the Hague.</p>

<p>Dr Franklin and Mr Jay had now been for three or
four months actively engaged in the negotiation of peace
at Paris. Having thus brought affairs to a happy issue in
Holland, Mr Adams hastened to join the Commissioners,
and arrived in Paris before the end of October. From
that time till the Preliminary Articles were signed, November
the 30th, he applied himself unremittingly with his
colleagues to the details of the negotiation. He also took
part in the discussions respecting the Definitive Treaty,
which followed from time to time, and was one of the
signers of that instrument.</p>

<p>In the winter of 1784 he was in Holland. In January,
1785, he was appointed the first American Minister Plenipotentiary
to the Court of St James's. While in England,
he wrote his Defence of the American Constitutions. In
the year 1788 permission was granted him to return home,
where he arrived after an absence of almost nine years,
during the whole of which period he had been employed
in services of the highest responsibility and importance.
He was shortly afterwards elected Vice President of the
United States, under the first Presidency of Washington.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">&nbsp;</a></span></p>

<p class="letter_open">Dear Sir,
</p>

<p>With great pleasure to ourselves we discharge our duty,
by enclosing to you your commission for representing these
United States at the Court of France. We are by no
means willing to admit a thought of your declining this important
service, and therefore we send duplicates of the
commission, and the late resolves, in order that you may
take one set with you, and send the other by another
vessel.</p>

<p>These are important papers, and therefore we wish
they may be put into the hands of a particular and careful
person, with directions to deliver them himself into the
hands of the Commissioners. Mr Hancock, before he
left this place, said that he intended to send a gentleman
to France on some particular business. Cannot we prevail
to get this gentleman to undertake the delivery of our
packet to the Commissioners, they paying the expense of
travel to Paris, and back again to his place of business?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>It is unnecessary to mention the propriety of directing
these despatches to be bagged with weight proper for sinking
them, on any immediate prospect of their otherwise

<h3>TO SAMUEL ADAMS.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">
Passy, May 21st, 1778.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Dear Sir,
</p>

<p>I have never yet paid my respects to you since my arrival
in Europe, for which seeming neglect of duty, the
total novelty of the scenes about me, and the incessant
avocations of business, and ceremony, and pleasure, (for
this last, I find in Europe, makes an essential part of both
the other two,) must plead my excuse.</p>

<p>The situation of the general affairs of Europe is still
critical and of dubious tendency. It is still uncertain
whether there will be war between the Turks and the
Russians, between the Emperor and the King of Prussia,
and indeed between England and France, in the opinion
of many people. My own conjecture, however, is that a
war will commence, and that soon.</p>

<p>Before this reaches you, you will be informed that a
strong squadron of thirteen capital ships and several frigates
has sailed from Toulon, and that another squadron is
ordered to sail from Spithead. Whatever I may have
heard of the destination of the first, I am not at liberty
to mention it. We have no intelligence that the latter
has sailed.</p>

<p>Chatham the great is no more, but there is so much of
his wild spirit in his last speech yet left in the nation, that
I have no doubt but the administration will put all to the
hazard.</p>

<p>We are happy to hear by the frigate, La Sensible,
which has returned to Brest, that the treaty arrived safe
at Casco Bay. We hope to have the earliest intelligence
of the ratification of it. The Commissioners from England,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
of the 22d of April, will meet, as we suppose, with
nothing but ridicule. The King of Prussia is yet upon
the reserve concerning America, or rather forgetting his
promise, has determined not to acknowledge our independence
at present. His reason is obvious; he wants the
aid of those very German princes, who are most subservient
to Great Britain, who have furnished her with troops
to carry on the war against us, and, therefore, he does not
choose to offend them by an alliance with us at present.
Spain is on the reserve too, but there is not the least doubt
entertained here of her intention to support America. In
Holland there is more friendship for us than I was aware
of before I came here; at least, they will take no part
against us.</p>

<p>Our affairs in this kingdom I find in a state of confusion
and darkness, that surprises me. Prodigious sums of
money have been expended, and large sums are yet due;
but there are no books of account, nor any documents from
whence I have been able to learn what the United States
have received as an equivalent.</p>

<p>There is one subject which lies heavily on my mind,
and that is the expense of the Commissioners. You have
three Commissioners at this Court, each of whom lives at
an expense of at least three thousand pounds sterling a
year, I fear at a greater expense; few men in the world
are capable of living at a less expense than I am. But I
find the other gentlemen have expended from three to four
thousand a year each, and one of them from five to six.
And by all the inquiries I have been able to make, I cannot
find any article of expense which can be retrenched.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>The truth is, in my humble opinion, our system is
wrong in many particulars.</p>

<p>1. In having three Commissioners at this Court; one
in the character of Envoy is enough. At present, each of
the three is considered in the character of a public Minister
Plenipotentiary, which lays him under an absolute necessity
of living up to this character, whereas, one alone
would be obliged to incur no greater expense, and would
be quite sufficient for all the business of a public Minister.</p>

<p>2. In leaving the salaries of these Ministers at an uncertainty,
you will never be able to obtain a satisfactory
account of the public monies while this system continues;
it is a temptation to live at too great an expense, and gentlemen
will feel an aversion to demanding a vigorous account.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>3. In blending the business of a public Minister with
that of a commercial agent. The business of various departments
is by this means so blended, and the public
and private expenses so confounded with each other, that
I am sure no satisfaction can ever be given to the public
of the disposition of their interests, and I am very confident,
that jealousies and suspicions will hereafter arise
against the characters of gentlemen, who may, perhaps,
have acted with perfect integrity and the fairest intentions
for the public good.</p>

<p>My idea is this; separate the offices of public Ministers
from those of commercial agents;<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> recall, or send to some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
other Court, all the public Ministers but one at this Court;
determine with precision the sum that shall be allowed to
the remaining one for his expenses, for his salary, and
for his time, risk, trouble, &amp;c.; and when this is done, see
that he receives no more than his allowance. The inconveniences
arising from the multiplicity of Ministers and the
complication of business are infinite.</p>

<p>Remember me with the most tender affection to my
worthy colleagues, and to all others to whom you know
they are due.</p>

<p>
I am your friend and servant,</p>

<h3>TO THE COMMERCIAL COMMITTEE.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">
Passy, May 24th, 1778.</p>

<p>Gentlemen,
</p>

<p>I find that the American affairs on this side of the
Atlantic are in a state of disorder, very much resembling
that which is so much to be regretted on the other, and
arising, as I suppose, from the same general causes, the
novelty of the scenes, the inexperience of the actors, and
the rapidity with which great events have succeeded each
other. Our resources are very inadequate to the demands
made upon us, which are perhaps unnecessarily increased
by several irregularities of proceeding.</p>

<p>We have in some places two or three persons, who
claim the character of American agents, agent for commercial
affairs, and continental agent, for they are called by all
these different appellations. In one quarter, one gentleman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
claims the character from the appointment of Mr
William Lee, another claims it from the appointment of the
Commissioners at Passy, and a third from the appointment
of the Commercial Committee of Congress. This introduces
a triple expense, and much confusion and delay.
These evils have been accidental, I believe, and unavoidable,
but they are evils still, and ought to be removed.</p>

<p>One person at Bordeaux, another at Nantes, and a
third perhaps at Havre de Grace, or Dunkirk, would be
amply sufficient for all public purposes, and to these persons
all orders from Congress, or the Commercial Committee,
or the Commissioners at Paris, ought to be addressed.
To the same persons all public ships of war,
and all other ships belonging to the United States, and
their prizes, ought to be addressed; and all orders for the
supplies of provisions, clothing, repairs of vessels, &amp;c. as
well as all orders for shipping of merchandises, or warlike
stores for the United States, ought to go through their
hands. We have such abuses and irregularities every day
occurring, as are very alarming. Agents of various sorts
are drawing bills upon us, and the commanders of vessels
of war are drawing upon us for expenses and supplies,
which we never ordered, so that our resources will soon
fail, if a speedy stop is not put to this career.</p>

<p>And we find it so difficult to obtain accounts from agents
of the expenditure of monies, and of the goods and merchandises
shipped by them, that we can never know the
true state of our finances, or when and in what degree we
have executed the orders of Congress for sending them
arms, clothes, medicines, or other things.</p>

<p>In order to correct some of the abuses, and to bring our
affairs into a little better order, I have constantly given my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
voice against paying for things we never ordered, against
paying persons who have never been authorised, and
against throwing our affairs into a multiplicity of hands in
the same place. But the consequence has been so many
refusals of demands and requests, that I expect much discontent
will arise from it, and many clamors. Whether the
appointment by Congress of one or more consuls for this
kingdom would remedy these inconveniences, I must submit
to their wisdom.</p>

<p>
I have the honor to be, &amp;c.</p>

<h3>TO JAMES LOVELL.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">
Passy, July 9th, 1778.</p>

<p>My Dear Friend,
</p>

<p>I had yesterday the honor of receiving the despatches
from Congress, which were sent by the Saratoga from Baltimore,
arrived at Nantes, convoyed in by the Boston,
Captain Tucker, (who was returning from a short cruise,
and who has sent in four prizes,) and those by the Spy,
from New London, arrived at Brest, and the inexpressible
pleasure of your private letters by the same vessels. You
acquaint me, that you had written to me eight or nine
times, which has given me some anxiety, as these letters
are the first I have received from you or from any member
of Congress, since my arrival in France.</p>

<p>The ratification of the treaty gives universal joy to this
Court and nation, who seem to be sincerely and deeply
rejoiced at this connexion between the two countries.</p>

<p>There is no declaration of war as yet at London or
Versailles, but the ships of the two nations are often fighting
at sea, and there is not the smallest doubt but war will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
be declared, unless Britain should miraculously have wisdom
given her to make a treaty with the Congress like
that which France has made. Spain has not made a
treaty, but be not deceived nor intimidated, all is safe in
that quarter.</p>

<p>The unforeseen dispute in Bavaria has made the Empress
Queen and King of Prussia cautious of quarrelling
with Great Britain, because her connexion with a
number of the German Princes, whose aid each of those
potentates is soliciting, makes her friendship, or at least her
neutrality in the German war, of importance to each.
But this will do no hurt to America.</p>

<p>You have drawn so many bills of exchange upon us,
and sent us so many frigates, every one of which costs us
a large sum of money, so many merchandises and munitions
of war have been sent, whether arrived or not, and we expect
so many more drafts upon us, that I assure you I am
very uneasy concerning our finances here. We are laboring
to hire money, and have some prospect of success, but
I am afraid not for such sums as will be wanted.</p>

<p>Let me entreat you to omit no opportunity of writing
me; send me all the newspapers, journals, &amp;c. and believe
me your friend and servant,</p>

<h3>TO JAMES LOVELL.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">
Passy, July 26th, 1778.</p>

<p class="letter_open">My Dear Friend,
</p>

<p>Your favors of May 16th and 25th, by Captain Barnes
reached me yesterday. These, with those by Niles from
Connecticut, and those by the Saratoga from Baltimore,
are all that I have received from you, or from anybody at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
Congress; which gives me pain, because your other letters
must have miscarried, and I hold your letters in so high
esteem, that I cannot be willing to lose one.</p>

<p>The robbery of Folger's packet, by all that I can learn,
must have been committed by a traitor, who made his
escape to England. But Dr Franklin and Mr Lee, who
were acquainted with this transaction, will, I suppose, develope
the mystery as far as they are able. One of these
gentlemen has some other suspicions, but I believe the fugitive
to England was the only thief.</p>

<p>Mr Deane, whom you mention, is no doubt with you
before now, but if the Count d'Estaing has not been able
to strike a decisive blow before the arrival of Byron, I
should fear that some misfortune has befallen him since the
junction of Byron and Howe. We are, however, anxious
to know the naval man&oelig;uvres in America, as well as those
of the armies. Mr Deane complains of ill treatment, and
claims great merit for his services. I shall not add to the
ill treatment, nor depreciate the merit, but it will never do
for Congress to dread the resentment of their servants.
I have heard a great deal in this country concerning his
conduct; great panegyrics and harsh censures. But I believe
he has neither the extravagant merit that some persons
ascribe to him, nor the gross faults to answer for,
which some others impute or suspect. I believe he was a
diligent servant of the public, and rendered it useful service.
His living was expensive, but whether he made the
vast profit to himself that some persons suspect, I know
not, or whether any profit at all. One thing I know, that
my family will feel that I shall not imitate him in this faculty,
if it really was his; for which reason I wish Congress
would determine, what allowance we shall have for our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
time, that I might know whether my family can live upon
it or not.</p>

<p>Extravagant claims to merit are always to be suspected.
General Gates was the ablest negotiator you ever had in
Europe,<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> and next to him, General Washington's attack
upon the enemy at Germantown. I do not know, indeed,
whether this last affair had not more influence upon the
European mind than that of Saratoga. Although the attempt
was unsuccessful, the military gentlemen in Europe
considered it as the most decisive proof that America
would finally succeed.</p>

<p>And you may depend upon it, although your agents in
Europe were to plead with the tongues of men and angels,
although they had the talents and the experience of Mazarin,
or the integrity of d'Asset, your army in America will
have more success than they.</p>

<p>I foresee there will be diversities of sentiment concerning
this gentleman, (Deane,) and perhaps warm debates.
Perhaps there will be as much as there has been about a
General in the northern department. All that I request is,
that I may not be drawn into the dispute. Europe has
not charms enough for me to wish to stay here to the exclusion
of abler negotiators, much less at the expense of
heat and divisions in Congress. How well united you
were in the choice of me I never was informed, and how
soon attempts may be made to displace me I know not.
But one thing I beg of my friends, and one only, that if
any attempt of that kind should be made, they would give
me up, rather than continue my residence at the expense
of debates in Congress, and by the favor of small majorities.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>If I were capable of speculating in English funds, or of
conducting private trade, I might find opportunities here to
make a private profit, and might have inducements from
private considerations to continue here; but this will never
be my case, and I am very well persuaded that Congress
will never grant me so much for my services here, as I
could earn by my profession in Boston, to which I will return
with submission to old ocean, old Boreas, and British men
of war, the moment I am released from this station. I wish
however that Congress would determine what allowance
they will grant, that honest men may not be made or suspected
otherwise. As to the public, I am fully persuaded
that its interests are not at all concerned in my residence
here, as there is a great plenty of persons quite as well
qualified.</p>

I am, &amp;c.</p>

<h3>TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">
Passy, July 27th, 1778.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,
</p>

<p>I thank you for your kind congratulations on the favorable
appearances in our American concerns, and for so
politely particularizing one of the most inconsiderable of
them, my safe arrival in France, which was after a very
inconvenient passage of fortyfive days.</p>

<p>Your letter to Mr Izard I had the pleasure to send to
him immediately in Paris, where he resides, the Court of
Tuscany being so connected with that of Vienna, as to
discourage hitherto his departure for Italy. He did me
the honor of a visit yesterday, when we had much conversation
upon American affairs.</p>

<p>Your other letter to your daughter-in-law, I have forwarded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
by a safe opportunity. You may depend upon
my conveying your letters to any of your friends by the
best opportunities, and with despatch. The more of your
commands you send me, the more pleasure you will give
me.</p>

<p>War is not declared, that is, no manifesto has been published,
but each nation is daily manufacturing materials for
the other's manifesto, by open hostilities. In short, Sir,
the two nations have been at war ever since the recall of
the Ambassadors. The King of France has given orders
to all his ships to attack the English, and has given vast
encouragement to privateers.</p>

<p>The King of Great Britain and his council have determined
to send instructions to their Commissioners in
America to offer us independency, provided we will make
peace with them, separate from France. This appears to
me to be the last effort to seduce, deceive, and divide.
They know that every man of honor in America must
receive this proposition with indignation. But they think
they can get the men of no honor to join them by such a
proposal, and they think the men of honor are not a majority.
What has America done to give occasion to that
King and council to think so unworthily of her.</p>

<p>The proposition is in other words this; "America, you
have fought me until I despair of beating you, you have
made an alliance with the first power of Europe, which
is a great honor to your country and a great stability to
your cause, so great that it has excited my highest resentment,
and has determined me to go to war with
France. Do you break your faith with that power and
forfeit her confidence, as well as that of all the rest of
mankind forever, and join me to beat her, or stand by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
neuter and see me do it, and for all this I will acknowledge
your independency, because I think in that case you
cannot maintain it, but will be an easy prey to me afterwards,
who am determined to break my faith with you, as
I wish you to do yours with France."</p>

<p>My dear countrymen, I hope you will not be allured
upon the rocks, by the syren song of peace. They are
now playing a sure game. They have run all hazards,
but now they hazard nothing.</p>

<p>I know your application is incessant and your moments
precious, and, therefore, that I ask a great favor in requesting
your correspondence, but the interests of the public,
as well as private friendship, induce me to do it.</p>

<p>
I am, &amp;c.</p>

<h3>TO SAMUEL ADAMS.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">
Passy, July 28th, 1778.</p>

<p class="letter_open">My Dear Sir,
</p>

<p>The Sovereign of Britain and his Council have determined
to instruct their Commissioners to offer you independence,
provided you will disconnect yourselves from
France.</p>

<p>The question arises, how came the King and Council
by authority to offer this? It is certain that they have it
not.</p>

<p>In the next place, is the treaty of alliance between us
and France now binding upon us? I think there is not
room to doubt it; for declarations and manifestos do not
make the state of war, they are only publications of the
reasons of war. Yet the message of the King of Great
Britain to both houses of Parliament, and their answers to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
that message were as full a declaration of war as ever was
made, and accordingly hostilities have been frequent ever
since. This proposal, then, is a modest invitation to a gross
act of infidelity and breach of faith. It is an observation
that I have often heard you make, that "France is the natural
ally of the United States." This observation is, in my
opinion, both just and important. The reasons are plain.
As long as Great Britain shall have Canada, Nova Scotia,
and the Floridas, or any of them, so long will Great Britain
be the enemy of the United States, let her disguise it as
much as she will.</p>

<p>It is not much to the honor of human nature, but the fact
is certain, that neighboring nations are never friends in reality.
In the times of the most perfect peace between them,
their hearts and their passions are hostile, and this will certainly
be the case forever between the thirteen United
States and the English colonies. France and England, as
neighbors and rivals, never have been and never will be
friends. The hatred and jealousy between the nations
are eternal and irradicable. As we, therefore, on the one
hand, have the surest ground to expect the jealousy and
hatred of Great Britain, so on the other we have the
strongest reasons to depend upon the friendship and alliance
of France, and no one reason in the world to expect
her enmity or her jealousy, as she has given up every pretension
to any spot of ground on the Continent. The
United States, therefore, will be for ages the natural bulwark
of France against the hostile designs of England
against her, and France is the natural defence of the
United States against the rapacious spirit of Great Britain
against them. France is a nation so vastly eminent, having
been for so many centuries what they call the dominant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
power of Europe, being incomparably the most powerful
at land, that united in a close alliance with our States, and
enjoying the benefit of our trade, there is not the smallest
reason to doubt, but both will be a sufficient curb upon the
naval power of Great Britain.</p>

<p>This connexion, therefore, will forever secure a respect
for our States in Spain, Portugal, and Holland too, who will
always choose to be upon friendly terms with powers, who
have numerous cruisers at sea, and indeed in all the rest, of
Europe. I presume, therefore, that sound policy as well
as good faith will induce us never to renounce our alliance
with France, even although it should continue us for
some time in war. The French are as sensible of the
benefits of this alliance to them as we are, and they are
determined as much as we to cultivate it.</p>

<p>In order to continue the war, or at least that we may do
any good in the common cause, the credit of our currency
must be supported. But how? Taxes, my dear Sir,
taxes. Pray let our countrymen consider and be wise;
every farthing they pay in taxes is a farthing's worth of
wealth and good policy. If it were possible to hire money
in Europe to discharge the bills, it would be a dreadful
drain to the country to pay the interest of it. But I fear it
will not be. The house of Austria has sent orders to Amsterdam
to hire a very great sum, England is borrowing
great sums, and France is borrowing largely. Amidst such
demands for money, and by powers who offer better terms,
I fear we shall not be able to succeed.</p>

<p>Pray write me as often as you can, and believe me your
friend and servant,</p>

<h3>TO JAMES WARREN.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">
Passy, August 4th, 1778.</p>

<p>My Dear Sir,
</p>

<p>Your kind favor of July the 1st was brought here
yesterday from Bordeaux, where Captain Ayres has arrived,
but was not delivered to me till this day. This is
the second only received from you. I have infinite satisfaction
in learning from all parts of America the prosperous
train of our affairs, and the unanimity and spirit of the
people. Every vessel brings us fresh accessions of ardor
to the French, and of depression to the English, in the
war that is now begun in earnest.</p>

<p>The resolutions of Congress upon the Conciliatory Bills,
the address to the people, the ratification of the treaty,
the answer to the Commissioners, the President's letter,
the message of G. Livingston, and the letter of Mr
Drayton, are read here with an avidity that would surprise
you. It is not one of the least misfortunes of Great
Britain, that she has to contend with so much eloquence;
that there are such painters to exhibit her atrocious actions
to the world, and transmit them to posterity. Every publication
of this kind seems to excite the ardor of the
French nation, and of their fleets and armies, as much as
if they were Americans.</p>

<p>While American orators are thus employed in perpetuating
the remembrance of the injustice and cruelty of
Great Britain towards us, the French fleet has been giving
such a check to her naval pride, as she has not experienced
before for many ages. The vessel, which is to
carry this, will carry information of a general engagement
between d'Orvilliers and Keppel, which terminated in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
disgraceful flight of the English fleet. We hope soon to
hear of d'Estaing's success, which would demonstrate to
the universe, that Britain is no longer mistress of the
ocean. But the events of war are always uncertain, and
a misfortune may have happened to the French fleet in
America. But even if this should be the case, which I do
not believe, still Britain is not mistress of the sea, and
every day will bring fresh proofs that she is not. The
springs of her naval power are dried away.</p>

<p>I have hitherto had the happiness to find that my pulse
beat in exact unison with those of my countrymen. I
have ventured with some freedom to give my opinion, as
to what Congress would do with the Conciliatory Bills, with
the Commissioners, with the treaty, &amp;c. &amp;c. and every
packet brings us proceedings of Congress, according in
substance, but executed in a manner infinitely exceeding
my abilities. Nothing has given me more joy, than the
universal disdain that is expressed both in public and private
letters, at the idea of departing from the treaty and
violating the public faith. This faith is our American
glory, and it is our bulwark. It is the only foundation
on which our union can rest securely, it is the only support
of our credit both in finance and commerce; it is our sole
security for the assistance of foreign powers. If the British
Court with their arts could shake it, or the confidence
in it, we should be undone forever. They would triumph
over us, after all our toil and danger. They would subjugate
us more entirely than they ever intended. The idea
of infidelity cannot be treated with too much resentment
or too much horror. The man who can think of it with
patience is a traitor in his heart, and ought be execrated
as one, who adds the deepest hypocrisy to the blackest
treason.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>Is there a sensible hypocrite in America, who can start
a jealousy, that religion may be in danger? From whence
can this danger arise? Not from France, she claims no
inch of ground upon your continent. She claims no legislative
authority over you, no negative upon your laws, no
right of appointing you bishops, nor of sending you missionaries.
Besides, the spirit of crusading for religion is
not in France. The rage for making proselytes, which
has existed in former centuries, is no more. There is a
spirit more liberal here in this respect, than I expected to
find. Where has been the danger to the religion of the
Protestant cantons of Switzerland, from an alliance with
France, which has subsisted with entire harmony for one
hundred and fifty years, or thereabouts? But this subject
is fitter for ridicule than serious argument, as nothing can
be clearer than that in this enlightened tolerant age, at this
vast distance, without a claim or color of authority, with
an express acknowledgment and warranty of sovereignty,
this, I had almost said tolerant nation, can never endanger
our religion.</p>

<p>The longer I live in Europe, and the more I consider
our affairs, the more important our alliance with France
appears to me. It is a rock upon which we may safely
build. Narrow and illiberal prejudices, peculiar to John
Bull, with which I might perhaps have been in some degree
infected when I was John Bull, have now no influence
over me. I never was, however, much of John Bull. I
was John Yankee, and such I shall live and die. Is Great
Britain to be annihilated? No such thing. A revolution in
her government may possibly take place. But whether in
favor of despotism or republicanism, is the question. The
scarcity of virtue, and even the semblance of it, seems an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
invincible obstacle to the latter. But the annihilation of a
nation never takes place. It depends wholly on herself to
determine whether she shall sink down into the rank of
the middling powers of Europe, or whether she shall maintain
the second place in the scale. If she continues this
war, the first will be her fate, if she stops short in her mad
career and makes peace, she may still be in the second
predicament. America will grow with astonishing rapidity,
and England, France, and every other nation in
Europe will be the better for her prosperity. Peace,
which is her dear delight, will be her wealth and her glory,
for I cannot see the seed of a war with any part of the
world in future, but with Great Britain, and such States as
may be weak enough, if any such there should be, to become
her allies. That such a peace may be speedily concluded,
and that you and I may return to our farms to enjoy
the fruits of it, spending our old age in recounting to
our children the toils and dangers we have encountered for
their benefit, is the wish of your friend,</p>

<h3>TO RICHARD HENRY LEE.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">
Passy, August 5th, 1778.</p>

<p class="letter_open">My Dear Sir,
</p>

<p>Your letter of the 20th of June, by Captain Ayres, from
Boston, had a quick passage. He sailed on the 4th of
July, and your letters were brought to Passy from Bordeaux,
where she arrived the 3d of August.</p>

<p>I thank you, Sir, for the kind expressions of your obliging
anxiety for me. The uncertainty in which you remain
so long, concerning the fate of the Boston, must have been
occasioned by the capture of many vessels by which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
news was sent, together with many bundles of English
newspapers and pamphlets. The prompt ratification of
the treaties, as well as the dignity with which you have
received the letters from the British Commissioners, has
given great satisfaction here. The two articles, the Count
de Vergennes agreed, when we presented your instructions
to him on that head, should be given up.</p>

<p>The confederation is an important object, and nothing
is more wished for in Europe than its completion, and the
finishing of the separate governments. The eagerness to
complete the American code, and the strains of panegyric
in which they speak and write of those parts of it, which
have been published in Europe, are very remarkable, and
seem to indicate a general revolution in the sentiments of
mankind upon the subject of government. Our currency
cannot engage our attention too much. And the more
we think of it, the more we shall be convinced, that taxation,
deep and broad taxation, is the only sure and lasting
remedy. Loans in Europe will be very difficult to obtain.
The powers at war, or at the eve of war, have such vast
demands, and offer terms so much better than ours, that
nothing but sheer benevolence to our cause can induce any
person to lend us. Besides a large foreign debt would
be a greater evil, for what I know, than a paper currency.
Moreover, your large drafts upon the Commissioners here,
from various quarters, are like to consume more money
than we can borrow. We shall do however all we can.</p>

<p>I have hitherto had the good fortune to preserve a good
understanding with the gentleman you mention, and shall
endeavor to continue it. I have long known him to be
employed very ably and usefully for our country, and his
merits and services, his integrity and abilities, will induce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
me to cultivate his friendship, as far as I can, consistently
with the public service. I wish I could converse with you
freely upon this subject, but it would lead me into too long
a detail. It has given me much grief, since my arrival
here, to find so little harmony among many respectable
characters; so many mutual jealousies, and so much distrust
of one another. As soon as I perceived it, I determined
neither to quarrel with any man here, because he
had quarrelled with another, or because another had quarrelled
with him; nor to make any man my bosom friend,
because he was the bosom friend of any other; but to attend
solely to the public service, and give my voice upon all
occasions, as I should think that justice and policy required,
whether it agreed with the opinion of one man or another.
I cannot be more particular. If I were to take every man's
word, I should think there was not one disinterested American
here, because it is very certain, that there is nobody
here, that everybody speaks well of. There is no doubt to
be made, that private interest has some influence here
upon some minds, and that our mercantile affairs and competitions
have occasioned some altercation. But there is,
I think, rather more of mutual reproaches of interested
views and designs, rather more of animosity among the
Americans here, than I remember to have seen anywhere
else. I will have nothing to do with any of these things.
I will have nothing to do with designs and endeavors to
run down characters, to paint in odious colors indifferent
actions, to excite or propagate suspicions without evidence,
or to foment or entertain prejudices of any kind, if I can
possibly avoid it. I am really ashamed to write to you in
this enigmatical manner, which is not natural to me; but
I know not how to write clearer at present. I sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
differ in sentiment from each of my colleagues, and sometimes
agree with each; yet I do not trim, or at least I think
I do not. It has been and shall be my endeavor to heal
and reconcile, to the utmost of my power, Yet I fear, that
some gentlemen are gone over to America, heated with
altercation and inflamed with prejudice. Others still remain
here, it is to be feared, in the same temper of mind,
and probably many letters are gone over loaded. These
things will probably make you uncomfortable, as they have
and will make us. I really wish, however, that you would
remove the cause of this, and appoint consuls to do the
mercantile business. If you do not, however, I am determined
to go on, giving my voice clearly and without equivocation,
and at the same time without wrangling or ill will.</p>

<p>We expect on Sunday, the 9th, the English accounts of
the sea fight between d'Orvilliers and Keppel, which happened
on the 27th ult. in which the former obtained the
laurels, whatever representation the latter may make of it.
There are so many facts, attested by so many respectable
witnesses, that there is no room to doubt, but that the Britons
lost the day; a terrible loss indeed to a nation, who
have the empire of the sea to maintain, in order almost to
preserve their existence. It is not being equal to France
at sea; they must support a clear and decided superiority,
not only to France, but to France and Spain in conjunction,
not to mention our States, in order to preserve their
rank among the powers of Europe. My tenderest respects
to all good men.</p>

I am, dear Sir, affectionately yours,</p>

<p>The French fleet went out again from Brest the 17th, but
we have not yet heard that the English fleet is out. While
the two fleets were in the harbor, the British East India

<p>I have the honor to enclose to Congress all the newspapers
I have by me, enough to show that we have nothing
very important here at present. The French and British
fleets are again at sea, and we hourly expect intelligence
of a second battle; but our expectations from America are
still more interesting and anxious, having nothing from
them since the 3d of July, except what is contained in the
English gazettes.</p>

<p>Events have probably already passed in America, although
not known in Europe, which will determine the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
great question, whether we shall have a long war or a
short one. The eyes of all Europe are fixed upon Spain,
whose armaments by sea and land are vastly expensive
and extremely formidable, but whose designs are a profound,
impenetrable secret; time, however, will discover
them. In the meantime, we have the satisfaction to be
sure, that they are not inimical to America. For this, we
have the word of a King, signified by his Ministers, a
King, who they say never breaks his word, but, on the
contrary, has given many striking proofs of his sacred regard

Sir,
</p>

<p>As our finances are, at present, in a situation seriously
critical, and as I hold myself accountable to Congress
for every part of my conduct, even to the smallest
article of my expenses, I must beg the favor of you to
consider what rent we ought to pay you for this house and
furniture, both for the time past and to come. Every part
of your conduct towards me, and towards our Americans
in general, and in all our affairs, has been polite and obliging,
as far as I have had an opportunity of observing, and I
have no doubt it will continue so; yet it is not reasonable,
that the United States should be under so great an obligation
to a private gentleman, as that two of their representatives
should occupy, for so long a time, so elegant a seat, with
so much furniture and so fine accommodations without any
compensation; and in order to avoid the danger of the
disapprobation of our constituents on the one hand, for living
here at too great or at too uncertain an expense, and on
the other, the censure of the world for not making sufficient
compensation to a gentleman, who has done so much

<p>As you have an account against the Commissioners, or

<p class="letter_open">Sir,
</p>

<p>I have received the letter, which you did me the honor
to write to me on the 15th inst, making inquiry as to the
rent of my house, in which you live, for the past and the
future. When I consecrated my house to Dr Franklin,
and his associates, who might live with him, I made it fully
understood that I should expect no compensation, because
I perceived that you had need of all your means to send to
the succor of your country, or to relieve the distresses of
your countrymen escaping from the chains of their enemies.
I pray you, Sir, to permit this arrangement to
remain, which I made when the fate of your country was
doubtful. When she shall enjoy all her splendor, such
sacrifices on my part will be superfluous, or unworthy of
her, but, at present, they may be useful, and I am most
happy in offering them to you.</p>

<p>There is no occasion for strangers to be informed of my
proceeding in this respect. It is so much the worse for
those, who would not do the same if they had the opportunity,
and so much the better for me, to have immortalized
my house by receiving into it Dr Franklin and his associates.</p>

<h3>TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">
Passy, September 20th, 1778.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,
</p>

<p>I have the honor to enclose the latest gazettes, which
contain all the news of Europe. The news from America
by the way of London, which are contained in the <cite>Courier
de l'Europe</cite> of the 15th instant, have raised our expectations
and increased our anxiety. We are not without apprehensions,
that the Count d'Estaing may fall in with the
combined fleets of Howe and Byron.</p>

<p>The English are beginning to elevate their heads a little,
and to renew their old insolent language, both in coffee
houses and in daily papers. The refugees from America,
unable to bear the thought of being excluded forever from
that country, and still less that of soliciting for pardon from
their injured countrymen, and returning to see established
principles, which they detest, and forms of government,
against which they have ever combated, are said to be
indefatigable in instilling hopes into the King and Ministers,
that by persevering another campaign, and sending twenty
thousand more men to America, the people will be worn
out, and glad to petition for dependence upon them.</p>

<p>They flatter themselves and others with hopes, that
Spain will remain neuter, and that by intriguing in France,
they can get the French Ministry changed, and then that
they shall have little trouble from this quarter. Nothing
can be more whimsical, more groundless or ridiculous, than
all this. Yet it is said to amuse and please the credulous
multitude in that devoted island. Those, who pretend to
know the bosoms of the persons highest in power in that
kingdom, say, that they delight themselves with the thought,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
that if it is not in their power to reduce America once more
to their yoke, yet they are able to harass, to distress, and
to render miserable those whom they cannot subdue. That
they have some little compunction at the thought, that they
shall be ranked in history with the Philips and Alvas, the
Alberts and Gislers of this world; but this, instead of producing
repentance and reformation as it ought, engenders
nothing but rage, envy, and revenge. This revenge, however,
is impotent. Their marine and their finances are in
so bad a condition, that it is with infinite difficulty they can
cope with France alone, even at sea; and it seems to be
the intention of Providence, that they shall be permitted to
go on with their cruelties, just long enough to wean the
affection of every American heart, and make room for connexions
between us and other nations, who have not the
ties of language, of acquaintance, and of custom to bind us.</p>

humble servant,</p>

<h3>TO RALPH IZARD.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">
Passy, September 25th, 1778.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,
</p>

<p>I have received with much pleasure your favor of yesterday's
date. No apology was necessary for the delay of
so few days to answer a letter, the contents of which did
not, from any public consideration, require haste. My
most fervent wishes mingle themselves with yours, that the
happy time may soon arrive when we may enjoy the blessings
of peace, uninterrupted by disputes with any power
whatever. But alas! my apprehensions are very strong,
that we are yet at a distance from so great a felicity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>You will readily acknowledge the impropriety of my entering
into the question concerning the duty of the Commissioners
here, to have made the communications of the
treaty, which you mention. But of this you may be assured,
that I shall at all times hold myself obliged to you for
the communication of your sentiments upon any public
affair. I am therefore sorry, that in your letter you have
confined yourself to that part of the treaty, upon which I
particularly requested your sentiments. And I now take
the liberty to request your sentiments upon every part of
the treaty, which you conceive liable to doubtful construction,
or capable of producing discontent or dispute, for I
have the honor to be fully of your opinion, that it is of very
great importance to be upon our guard, and avoid every
cause of controversy with France as much as possible.
She is, and will be, in spite of the obstacles of language,
of customs, religion, and government, our natural ally
against Great Britain as long as she shall continue our
enemy, and that will be at least as long as she shall hold a
foot of ground in America, however she may disguise it,
and whatever peace or truce she may make.</p>

<p>Your sentiments of the fishery, as a source of wealth, of
commerce and naval power, are perfectly just, and therefore
this object will and ought to be attended to with precision,
and cherished with care. Nevertheless, agriculture
is the most essential interest of America, and even of the
Massachusetts Bay, and it is very possible to injure both,
by diverting too much of the thoughts and labor of the
people from the cultivation of the earth to adventures
upon the sea. And this, in the opinion of some persons,
has been a fault in the Massachusetts Bay. Experience has
taught us in the course of this war, that the fishery was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
so essential to our welfare as it was once thought. Necessity
has taught us to dig in the ground instead of fishing in
the sea for our bread, and we have found that the resource
did not fail us.</p>

<p>The fishery was a source of luxury and vanity, that did
us much injury; yet this was the fault of the management,
not of the fishery. One part of our fish went to the West
India Islands for rum, and molasses to be distilled into rum,
which injured our health and our morals; the other part
went to Spain and Portugal for gold and silver, almost the
whole of which went to London, sometimes for valuable
articles of clothing, but too often for lace and ribands. If,
therefore, the cessation of the fishery for twenty years to
come was to introduce the culture of flax and wool, which
it certainly would do as far as would be necessary for the
purposes of decency and comfort, if a loss of wealth should
be the consequence of it, the acquisition of morals and of
wisdom would perhaps make us gainers in the end.</p>

<p>These are vain speculations I know. The taste for rum
and ribands will continue, and there are no means for the
New England people to obtain them so convenient as the
fishery, and therefore the first opportunity will be eagerly
embraced to revive it. As a nursery of seamen, and a
source of naval power, it has been, and is an object of serious
importance, and perhaps indispensably necessary to the
accomplishment and the preservation of our independence.
I shall therefore always think it my duty to defend and
secure our rights to it with all industry and zeal, and shall
ever be obliged to you for your advice and co-operation.</p>

<p>Pardon the length of this letter, and believe me, with
much esteem, your friend and servant,</p>

<h3>TO RALPH IZARD.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">
Passy, October 2d, 1778.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,
</p>

<p>I have the pleasure of yours of the 28th, and agree with
you in sentiment, that if the money, which has heretofore
been squandered upon articles of luxury, could for the
future be applied to discharge our national debt, it would
be a great felicity. But is it certain that it will? Will not
the national debt itself be the means, at least a temptation
to continue, if not increase the luxury? It is with great
pleasure that I see you mention sumptuary laws. But is
there room to hope that our Legislatures will pass such
laws? Or that the people have, or can be persuaded to
acquire those qualities, that are necessary to execute such
laws? I wish your answer may be in the affirmative, and
that it may be found true in fact and experience. But much
prudence and delicacy will be necessary, I think, to bring
all our countrymen to this just way of thinking upon this
head. There is such a charm to the human heart in elegance,
it is so flattering to our self-love to be distinguished
from the world in general by extraordinary degrees of
splendor, in dress, in furniture, equipage, buildings, &amp;c.
and our countrymen, by their connexion with Europe, are
so much infected with the habit of this taste and these passions,
that I fear it will be a work of time and difficulty, if
not quite impracticable, to introduce an alteration; to
which the late condition of our trade and currency, besides
the great inequality of fortune, and the late enterprises
introduced by privateers, are dangerous enemies.</p>

<p>You ask my opinion, whether the reasons in your last
letter are well founded. It is observable, that the French<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
Court were not content with the treaty proposed by Congress,
which contained all, in my opinion, which is contained
in the article as it now stands in the treaty of the
6th of February. What motive they had for inserting the
words, "indefinite and exclusive," is left to conjecture.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>
The suspicion, that they meant more than the treaty proposed
by Congress expressed, arises from a fact, which
you remember, viz. that the French at the time of the last
peace claimed more. I wish to know if there is any letter
or memorial extant, in which such a claim is contained, or
whether it was only a verbal claim made by their Ambassadors.
Whether any of the magazines of that time
mention and discuss any such claim. If the fact is incontestible,
that they made such a claim, it is possible that it
may be revived under the words "indefinite and exclusive."
But I hope it will not, and I hope it was not intended
when these words were inserted. Yet I confess I
cannot think of any other reason for inserting them. The
word indefinite is not amiss, for it is a right of catching
fish and drying them on land, which is a right indefinite
enough. But the word exclusive is more mysterious. It
cannot mean that Americans and all other nations shall be
"excluded" from the same right of fishing and drying on
land, between the same limits of Bonavista and Riche. It
would be much easier to suppose, that the following
words, "in that part only, and in no other besides that,"
gave rise to the word "exclusive;" that is, that right
of fishing and drying within those limits, for which we
have excluded ourselves from all others. I will undertake
to show better reasons, or at least as good, for this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
sense of the word exclusive, as the most subtle interpreter
of treaties can offer for the other, although I think them
both untenable.</p>

<p>My opinion further is this, that as contemporaneous exposition
is allowed by all writers on the law of nations to
be the best interpreter of treaties, as well as of all other
writings, and as neither the treaty of Utrecht, or the treaty
of Paris in 1763, ever received such an interpretation as
you are apprehensive may hereafter be contended for, and
as the uninterrupted practice has been against such a construction,
so I think that the treaty of Paris of the 6th of
February, 1778, is not justly liable to such a construction,
and that it cannot be attempted with any prospect of success.
I agree with you, however, that as we are young
States, and not practised in the art of negotiation, it becomes
us to look into all these things with as much caution
and exactness as possible, and furnish ourselves with the
best historical light, and every other honest means of securing
our rights. For which reason I requested your sentiments
upon this subject in writing, and continue to desire
in the same way your observations on other parts of the
treaty. Reduced to writing, such things remain in letters
and letter books, as well as more distinctly in the memory,
and the same men or other men may recur to them at
future opportunities, whereas transient conversations, especially
among men who have many things to do and to
think of, slip away and are forgotten. I shall make use of
all the prudence I can, that these letters may not come to
the knowledge of improper persons, or be used to the disadvantage
of our country, or to you or me in our present
capacity.</p>

on the subject of our finances. The Doctor will communicate
to you our situation in that regard.</p>

<h3>TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">
Passy, December 3d, 1778.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,
</p>

<p>I have the honor to enclose to Congress the latest newspapers.
As they contain the speech at the opening of
Parliament, and some of the debates in both Houses, upon
the addresses in answer to it, they are of very great importance.
I learn by some newspapers and private letters,
that an opinion has been prevalent in America, that the
enemy intended to withdraw from the United States; and
considering the cruel devastations of the war, and the unfortunate
situation of our finances, nothing would give me
so much joy, as to see reasons to concur in that opinion,
and to furnish Congress with intelligence in support of it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
But I am sorry to say the reverse is too apparent. We may
call it obstinacy or blindness, if we will, but such is the state
of parties in England, so deep would be the disgrace, and
perhaps so great the personal danger to those who have
commenced and prosecuted this war, that they cannot but
persevere in it at every hazard, and nothing is clearer in
my mind, than that they never will quit the United States
until they are either driven or starved out of them. I
hope, therefore, Congress will excuse me for suggesting,
that there is but one course for us to take, which is to
concert every measure, and exert every nerve, for the
total destruction of the British power within the United
States.</p>

<p>
I have the honor to be, &amp;c.</p>

<h3>TO ELBRIDGE GERRY.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">
Passy, December 5th, 1778.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Dear Sir,
</p>

<p>It is necessary that you should be minutely informed of
the minutest and most secret springs of action here, if it
is possible. Yet the danger is so great of our letters being
taken, and getting into English newspapers, that it is very
discouraging to a free correspondence. I will, however,
take all the precaution in my power to have the letters
sunk, but if all these fail, and my letters become public,
the world must take them as they find them, and I hope
they will do more good upon the whole than harm.</p>

<p>This Court and nation appear to me, to be well convinced
of the utility to their interests of the American alliance.
But notwithstanding this, they appear to me to have
too much diffidence of us, too much diffidence of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
people of America, and too much reserve towards the
Commissioners here. I am not satisfied in the cause of
this. Whether they think, that the obstacles of language,
religion, laws, customs and manners, are obstacles in the
way of a perfect friendship, which cannot be removed,
and therefore that they shall lose our connexion as soon as
Britain comes to her senses; or whether they are embarrassed
by the conduct of Spain, and are acting in this reserved
manner, and with an appearance of irresolution in
hopes of her coming in; or whether they have any prejudices
against the personal characters of the Commissioners,
and are loth to be unreserved with them, for fear they
shall communicate either indiscreetly or by design anything
to the English, or to anybody here, who might convey
it to England; or whether all these motives together
have a share in it, I know not. Thus much is certain,
that ever since I have been here, I have never seen any
disposition in any Minister of State to talk with any of the
Commissioners, either upon intelligence from Spain or England,
upon the designs or negotiations of either, or any
other Court in Europe, or upon the conduct of the war
by sea or land, or upon their own plans or designs of
policy or war. If this reserve was ever thrown off to any
one, I should think, that putting it on to others had some
personal motive. But it is exactly equal and alike to all
three.</p>

<p>Each Commissioner here, before I came, had his own
set of friends, admirers, and dependents, both among the
French and Americans. Two households united in some
degree against one, very unjustly, I fear, and very impolitically.
But this set the friends of the two to injuring the
third in conversation, and they cannot forbear to do it, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
this day. This dissension, I suspect, has made the Ministry
cautious, lest in the course of altercations, improper use
should be made of free communications. For my own
part, however odd you may think it in me to say it, I have
no friends, much less dependents, here, and am determined
to have none, for I am convinced, that competitions among
these have done the evil; but I am determined, if I am
continued here, to have free communication with the Ministry
upon these subjects and to search them to the bottom.
The Ministry are candid men and sensible, and I am sure,
that some eclaircissements would do good.</p>

<p>However, I am reckoning without my host, for by the
bruits, which Mr Deane's letters have scattered, I may expect,
that the first vessel will bring my recall or removal to
some other Court. But wherever I am, my heart will
ever be anxious for the good of our country, and warm
with friendship for her friends, among whom you will ever
be reckoned in the foremost rank, by your most obedient,</p>

<p>I have had the honor to enclose to Congress the speech
at the opening of the British Parliament by several opportunities,
but as it opens the intention of the enemy, and

<h3>TO ROGER SHERMAN.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">
Passy, December 6th, 1778.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Dear Sir,
</p>

<p>From the long series of arduous services in which we
have acted together, I have had experience enough of your
accurate judgment, in cases of difficulty, to wish very often
that I could have the benefit of it here. To me it appears,
that there will be no more cordial friendship, nor for many
years to come any long peace between Great Britain and
America, and therefore the French alliance is and will be
an important barrier to us, and ought to be cultivated with
perfect faith and much tenderness. But still it is a delicate
and dangerous connexion. There is danger to the
simplicity of our manners, and to the principles of our constitution,
and there may be danger that too much will be demanded
of us. There is danger, that the people and their
representatives may have too much timidity in their conduct
towards this power, and that your ministers here may
have too much diffidence of themselves, and too much
complaisance for the Court. There is danger, that French
councils, and emissaries, and correspondents may have too
much influence in our deliberations.</p>

<p>I hope that this Court will not interfere, by attaching
themselves to persons, parties, or measures in America.
It would be ill policy, but no Court is always directed by
sound policy, and we cannot be too much upon our guard.
Some Americans will naturally endeavor to avail themselves
of the aid of the French influence, to raise their reputation,
to extend their influence, to strengthen their
parties, and in short to promote the purposes of private<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
ambition and interest. But these things must be guarded
against.</p>

<p>I wish for a letter from you as often as you can, and that
you would believe me your friend,</p>

<h3>TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">
Passy, December 8th, 1778.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,
</p>

<p>I have the honor to enclose to Congress one other copy
of the speech at the opening of Parliament, together with
the debates in consequence of it.</p>

<p>The hints in those debates, especially those given out
by Lord Suffolk, are confirmed by the general strain of
intelligence from London. Letters from persons, who are
supposed to know, announce the determination of the cabinet
to be, that Clinton and Byron, with their fleet and army,
shall ravage the coast, and bombard and pillage the towns,
that their army in Canada shall be reinforced, and that
parties of regulars, with such tories and Indians as they can
persuade to join them, shall ravage, burn, and massacre on
the frontiers of Massachusetts Bay, New York, New Jersey,
Pennsylvania, Virginia and the Carolinas.</p>

<p>Their magnificent menaces we know it is not in their
power to execute entirely, yet we may depend they will
do as much as they can. They will neither acknowledge
our independence, nor withdraw their fleets and armies,
nor shall we get rid of them, but by destroying them, or
making them prisoners, until the nation is so exhausted,
and their credit so sunk, that the Minister can raise no
more money.</p>

<p>It has been usual to consider this as a ministerial war,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
but I have ever thought, they would some time or other
discover it to be a national war; the few men of the
nation, who think seriously of the business, see clearly in
the long train of consequences of American independence
the loss of their West India Islands, a great part of their
East India trade, the total loss of Canada, Nova Scotia,
the Floridas, all the American fisheries, a diminution of
their naval power, as well as national bankruptcy, and a
revolution in their government in favor of arbitrary power.
And the nation in general has a confused dread of all
these things upon its spirits.</p>

<p>The inference they draw from all this is to go on with
the war, and make it more cruel, which is the way in the
opinion of impartial persons to make all their gloomy visions
realities, whereas the only way to prevent them is
to make peace now, before a total alteration takes place
on both sides. However, all we can do is to be prepared
for the worst they can do.</p>

<h3>THE COMMISSIONERS TO JOHN PAUL JONES.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">
Passy, May 25th, 1778.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,
</p>

<p>Your favors of May 9th and 16th from Brest, we duly
received. We congratulate you on your success, and safe
arrival at Brest, as well as on the honor you have acquired
by your conduct and bravery in taking one of the King's
ships.</p>

<p>As we have some expectation of obtaining an exchange
of prisoners from England, we would advise you to keep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
those you have made securely confined, though in a manner
most consistent with humanity, till we have an answer
from thence. For if we can get an equal number of our
own seamen to man the Drake, she will be an additional
strength to you in a future expedition. Whereas sending
her with the prisoners to America, will not only weaken
you by the hands you must spare to navigate her, and to
keep the prisoners in subjection, but will also hazard their
being retaken. We should have been happy to have been
early informed of the particulars of your cruise, and of the
prizes you have made, of which we have no authentic
advice to this hour.</p>

<p>Your bill of exchange in favor of M. Bussolle for twentyfour
thousand livres, which you inform us you mean to
distribute among the brave officers and men to whom you
owe your late success has been presented to us by M.
Chaumont. We are sorry to inform you, that we have
been under the disagreeable necessity of refusing payment,
and that for several reasons; first, because your application
should have been made to M. Schweighauser, who is
the person regularly authorised to act as Continental Agent
at Brest, and we are determined that all American concerns,
within our department, shall go through his hands,
as long as he shall continue in the character of American
Agent, or at least until we shall find it necessary to order
otherwise. Secondly, because the bill is drawn for an expense,
which we have no right or authority to defray. We
have no authority to make presents of the public money to
officers or men, however gallant and deserving, for the
purpose of providing their families with clothing, or for any
other purpose, nor to advance them money upon the credit
of their share of prizes, nor have we authority to advance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
them any part of their pay or bounties; all these things
belong to Congress alone, and must be done by the proper
Boards in America. Our authority extends no further than
to order the necessary repairs to be made to your ship, to
order her to be furnished with necessary victuals, which
we are ready to order M. Schweighauser to do as soon as
we shall be informed by you what repairs and victuals are
wanted, with an estimate of the amount of the expenses.</p>

<p>There is one thing further, which we should venture to
do for the benefit of your men. Upon a representation
from you of the quantity of slops necessary for them, we
should order M. Schweighauser to furnish your ship with
them; not more however than one suit of clothes for each
man, that you may take them on board of your ship, and
deliver them out to the men as they shall be wanted,
charging each man upon the ship's books with what he
shall receive, that it may be deducted out of his pay.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Simpson has stated to us your having put
him under arrest for disobeying orders. As a court martial
must, by order of Congress, consist of three captains,
three lieutenants, and three captains of marines, and these
cannot be had here, it is our desire that he may have a
passage procured for him by the first opportunity to America,
allowing him whatever may be necessary for his defence.
As the consequences of an arrest in foreign countries
are thus extremely troublesome, they should be well
considered before they are made. If you are in possession
of any resolution of Congress, giving the whole of ships
of war when made prizes to the captors, we should be
obliged to you for a copy of it. We should also be obliged
to you for a particular account in whose hands the prizes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
made by you are, and in what forwardness is the sale of
them. We have the honor to be, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="letter_head">
Passy, June 3d, 1778.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,
</p>

<p>We have received sundry letters from Lieutenant Simpson,
and sundry certificates from officers and others, concerning
his behavior in general, and particularly upon that
occasion in which he is charged with disobedience of
orders. Without giving or forming any decided opinion
concerning his guilt or innocence of the crime laid to his
charge, we may venture to say, that the certificates we
have received are very favorable to his character, and at
least afford reason to hope, that he did not mean to disobey
his orders. Be this however as it may, we are constrained
to say, that his confinement on board of any other
ship than the Ranger, and much more his confinement in
a prison on shore, appears to us to carry in it a degree of
severity, which cannot be justified by reason or law. We
therefore desire you would release Mr Simpson from his
imprisonment, and permit him to go at large upon his
parole to go to Nantes, there to take his passage to America
by the first favorable opportunity, in order to take his
trial by a court martial.</p>

<p>We request you to transmit to us as soon as possible,
an account of what is due to Lieutenant Simpson, according
to the ship's books, for wages.</p>

<p>An application has been made to us in behalf of Mr Andrew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
Fallen, one of the prisoners lately made by you, and
his case represented with such circumstances as have induced
us to request you to let Mr Fallen go where he
will, after taking his parole in writing, that he will not communicate
any intelligence, which may be prejudicial to the
United States, that he will not take arms against them during
the war, and that he will surrender himself prisoner of
war, whenever called upon by Congress, or their Ministers
at Paris. We are, Sir, &amp;c.</p>

<h3>TO THE COMMITTEE OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">
Passy, February 1st, 1779.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Gentlemen,
</p>

<p>I had yesterday the honor of your favor of the 28th of
October, enclosing a resolution of Congress, of the 22d of
the same month, to which I shall give all the attention in
my power.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> I have much satisfaction in the reflection,
that I have hitherto endeavored with much sincerity to
conform to the spirit of it. What you recommend to me,
viz. to communicate to the Ministers of other Courts such
intelligence as I may receive, will not in future be so much
in my power; but as far as I can, while I stay in Europe,
I shall endeavor to comply. Indeed, it is a long time that
we have had no intelligence to communicate. Three
vessels we know have been taken, each of which had
many letters, and two of them public despatches; one
that sailed from Philadelphia the 4th of November, another
that sailed from the same port the 24th, and another that
sailed from Boston on the 20th. These letters and despatches
were all sunk, and we fear that others are lost.</p>

<p>It would be agreeable to me, indeed, if I were able to
throw any light on the subject of finances. As to a loan
in Europe, all has been done that was in our power to this
end, but without the desired effect. Taxation and economy
comprehend all the resources that I can think of.</p>

<p>We expect the honor of a visit from the Marquis de
Lafayette this morning, whom we shall receive with gratitude
for his gallant and glorious exertions in one of the
best causes in which a hero ever fought.</p>

<h3>TO SAMUEL ADAMS.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">
Passy, February 14th, 1779.</p>

<p class="letter_open">My Dear Sir,
</p>

<p>The Marquis de Lafayette did me the honor of a visit
yesterday, and delivered me your favor of the 25th of
October. I am not sorry, as things have been ordered,
that mine of May 24th did not reach you till the 24th of
October, because, as the new arrangement<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> was previously
made, it cannot be said that I had any hand in accomplishing
it. Yet I am glad the letter has arrived, because
it will show that the new system is quite agreeable to me,
that is, the appointment of a single Minister here. Believe
me, Sir, it was become very necessary.</p>

<p>How Congress will dispose of me, I do not know. If it
is intended that I shall return, this will be very agreeable to
me; and I think that this is the most probable opinion, because
Mr Deane's "Address" was on the 5th of December.
Congress soon after resolved to enter on foreign affairs
and go through them. The Alliance sailed on the 14th of
January, and there is no resolution arrived here respecting
me. I think, therefore, that it is my duty to return, and
that is my present determination; but whether I shall go
to Amsterdam, and from thence to St Eustatia, or to
Spain, and thence home, or in a French man-of-war to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
Martinique, or an American frigate to America, I have not
decided. Some hint that I am to go to Holland, others to
Spain. This last implies the removal of Mr Lee, which
would give me much pain on many accounts. I think
him a faithful man and able. Yet what the determination
will be upon the complaint of Mr Deane, I cannot
say. This is a subject which I cannot write or talk
about; I would not feel such another sensation to be made
a prince. I confess I expected the most dismal consequences
from it, because I thought it would render business
and confidence between us three totally impracticable;
that it would destroy all confidence between this Court
and us, and that it would startle Spain; that it would
alienate many in Holland from us, and that it would encourage
the Ministry in England and disconcert opposition
so much, that they would even make another vigorous
campaign, besides all the evils it would produce among
you. But the arrival of Dr Franklin's commission has
relieved me from many of these fears. This Court have
confidence in him alone. But I think they were cautious,
even of him, when he had two colleagues, to whom he was
obliged to communicate everything, one of whom was
upon as bad terms with him as with Mr Deane. I have
had a kind of a task here, as Mr Lovell expresses himself;
determined to be the partizan of neither, yet to be
the friend of both, as far as the service would admit. I
am fixed in these two opinions, that leaving the Doctor
here alone is right, and that Mr Lee is a very honest and
faithful man.</p>

<p>You say that France should be our polar star in case war
should take place. I was, I confess, surprised at this expression.
Was not war sufficiently declared in the King of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
England's speech, and in the answers of both Houses, and in
the recall of his Ambassador? Has it not been sufficiently
declared by actual hostilities in most parts of the world? I
suspect there will never be any other declaration of war.
Yet, there is in fact as complete a war as ever existed,
and it will continue, for you may depend upon it, the King
of France is immovably fixed in your support, and so are
his Ministers. Every suspicion of a wavering disposition
in this Court concerning the support of American independence
is groundless, is ridiculous, is impossible. You
may remember, that several years ago, several gentlemen
were obliged to reason, to show that American independence
was the interest of France. Since my arrival in
this Kingdom, I never yet found one man, nor heard of
more than one, who doubted it. If the voice of popularity
is anything, I assure you that this voice was never so
unanimous in America in favor of our independence as it
is here. It is so much so, that if the Court were to depart
from its present system in this respect, it is my clear opinion
it would make this nation very unhappy, and the Court
too; but I again repeat, that the Court is as fixed as the
nation. And this union of sentiment arises out of such
principles in nature, as, without a miracle, cannot alter.
Common sense in America supported independence;
common sense in France supports the alliance, and will
support it to the last. Nay, the common sense of Europe
supports the common sense of France.</p>

<p>By the way, my regards to Mr Paine, and tell him,
that I do not agree with him in his ideas about natural enemies.
It is because England is the natural enemy of
France, that America in her present situation is her natural
friend; at least, this is one cause, although there are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
many others. Some of them are more glorious, for human
nature.</p>

<p>France scarcely ever made a war before, that was popular
in Europe. There is not a State, that I can hear of,
but applauds her, and wishes her success. And in point of
finance and naval strength, and in skill and bravery of officers,
she seems to be superior to England. You may be
surprised to hear me say naval strength, yet if you consider
the wretched state of the British Navy, as to masts, yards,
rigging, and men, you will not wonder, although their
number of ships may be superior. I therefore think, that
all is safe. We may have further trouble, and trials of our
faith and patience. But trouble is to you and me familiar,
and I begin to think it necessary for my health.</p>

<p>There is one thing in my letter to you exaggerated; the
expenses of the Commissioners. I had been here but a
short time, and wrote according to the best guess I could
make, from what I had heard; but I now think I put it
much too high, yet I cannot say exactly.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p><em>February 20th.</em> There is not the least appearance of
the embarkation of troops for America, nor any intelligence
of transports taken up. The national discontent is
great, and tumults have arisen in Edinburgh and London.
According to present appearances, they will have
occasion for so many of their troops to keep their populace
in order, as to be able to spare few for America. Their
proclamations are all alike from Burgoyne's to those of the
Commissioners. The weaker they are, the more they puff.</p>

<h3>TO COUNT DE VERGENNES.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">
Passy, February 16th, 1779.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,
</p>

<p>Last evening I had the honor of your letter of the 13th
of this month, in answer to mine of the 11th.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p>I thank your Excellency for the politeness with which
you have agreed to my proposition, of a conference upon
the subject of Mr Deane's "Address to the People of the
United States."</p>

<p>At the time when my letter of the 11th was written and
sent to your Excellency, there were three Commissioners
here, representatives of Congress, between whom it appeared
to me Mr Deane's Address had a tendency to
destroy all confidence, as well as between your Excellency
and them, for which reason I thought it my duty to endeavor,
by a conference with your Excellency, to lessen those
evils as far as should be in my power.</p>

<p>But within a few hours after my letter of the 11th was
sent, the Aid-de-Camp of the Marquis de Lafayette arrived,
with despatches from Congress to Dr Franklin,
and from their Committee of Foreign Affairs to me, informing
me of the new arrangement by which Dr Franklin
is constituted Minister Plenipotentiary here, and I am restored
to the character of a private citizen; by which,
so wholly changed are the scene and the characters here,
that I now think I have no right to do what, if I had continued
in the character of a Commissioner, I should have
thought it my indispensable duty to do.</p>

<p>This masterly measure of Congress, which has my most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
hearty approbation, and of the necessity of which I was
fully convinced before I had been two months in Europe,
has taken away the possibilities of those dissensions, which
I so much apprehended. I shall not, therefore, give your
Excellency any further trouble, than to take an opportunity
of paying my respects in order to take leave, and to assure
you, that I shall leave this kingdom with the most entire
confidence in his Majesty's benevolence to the United
States, and inviolable adherence to the treaties between
the two powers, with a similar confidence in the good disposition
of his Majesty's Ministers of State and of this nation
towards us, and with a heart impressed with gratitude
for the many civilities which I have received, in the short
space I have resided here, at Brest, in the city, and in the
country, and particularly from your Excellency.</p>

<h3>TO THE MARQUIS DE LAFAYETTE.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">
Passy, February 21st, 1779.</p>

<p class="letter_open">My dear Marquis,
</p>

<p>The conversation with which you honored me last evening,
has induced me to give you the trouble of this letter
upon the same subject.</p>

<p>It is certain that a loan of money is very much needed
to redeem the redundancy of our paper bills, and without
it, it is impossible to foresee what will be the consequence to
their credit, and therefore every service, that may be rendered
in order to obtain it from this kingdom, from Spain,
or Holland, will be a most acceptable service.</p>

<p>But without some other exertions, even a loan perhaps
would be but a temporary relief; with them a smaller loan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
might suffice. You know perfectly well, that the enemy
in America are at present very weak, and in great distress
in every part. They are weak in Canada, weak in Halifax,
weak in Rhode Island, weak in New York, weak in
the Floridas, and weak in every one of the West India
Islands. A strong armament of ships of the line, with five
thousand troops, directed against Halifax, Rhode Island,
or New York, must infallibly succeed. So it must against
the Floridas, so it must against Canada, or any one of the
West India Islands.</p>

<p>You are very sensible, that in this state of weakness, the
British possessions in America depend upon each other for
reciprocal support. The troops and ships derive such
supplies of provisions from Canada and Nova Scotia, that
if these places or either of them were lost, it would be difficult,
if not impossible, for the other to subsist. The West
India Islands derive such supplies from the Floridas, that
if they were lost the others could hardly subsist. Their
fleets and armies in Canada, Halifax, Rhode Island, New
York, and the Floridas, receive supplies of rum, sugar, molasses,
&amp;c. from the West India Islands, without which
they could scarcely subsist. Every part of their possessions
in America, both on the continent and in the islands,
receives constant supplies from Europe, from England,
Scotland, and Ireland, without which they must fall. You
perceive, therefore, that their dominions in America at
present form such a chain, that the links mutually support
each other in such a manner, that if one or two were taken
away, the whole, or at least the greater part, must fall.
In this state of things then, the obvious policy is to send a
strong squadron of ships of the line to co-operate with the
Count d'Estaing and the American army, in some expedition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
directed against New York, Rhode Island, Halifax or
perhaps all of them in course. Five or six thousand troops
would be quite enough. Above all, it is indispensably necessary
to keep a clear naval superiority, both on the coast
of the continent, and in the West Islands. This together
with French and American privateers would make such
havoc among the enemy's transports, passing from one of
their possessions to another, as must ruin their affairs. The
French have a great advantage in carrying on this kind of
war in America, at present. The British ships are badly
manned and in bad repair. They cannot send them into
the American seas, without the utmost terror for their own
coasts. And when they are in America, they have not
such advantages for supplies of provisions, naval stores,
&amp;c. as the French.</p>

<p>The devastation, which was made among their ships of
the line, frigates, transports, and traders, in the American
seas the last summer, shows how much might be done, if a
stronger force were sent there. As long as the enemy have
possession of New York and Rhode Island, so long it will
be necessary for us to keep up large armies, to watch their
motions, and defend the country against them, which will
oblige us to emit more paper, and still further to increase
the depreciation. Now as long as they maintain the dominion
of those seas, their troops will be protected by the
cannon of their ships, and we could not dislodge them with
an army, however large, at least we could not keep possession
of those places. But if their force was captivated in
those seas, as it might easily be by a sea force, co-operating
with the land forces, we might reduce our army and innumerable
other articles of expense. We need not emit any
more paper, and that already out would depreciate no further.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
I should be happy to have further conversation with
you, Sir, upon these subjects, or to explain anything by
letter, which may be in my power.</p>

<p>With the highest sentiments of esteem and respect, I
have the honor to be, &amp;c.</p>

<h3>TO JOHN JAY, PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">
Passy, February 27th, 1779.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,
</p>

<p>By the new arrangement, which was brought by the
Marquis de Lafayette, I find myself restored to the character
of a private citizen.</p>

<p>The appointment of a single Minister at the Court of
Versailles was not unexpected to me, because I had not
been two months in Europe before I was convinced of the
policy, and indeed of the necessity, of such a measure.
But I ever entertained hopes, that when the news of such
an alteration should arrive, the path of my own duty would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
have been made plain to me by the directions of Congress,
either to return home or go elsewhere. But as no information
that we have received from Congress has expressed
their intentions concerning me, I am obliged to collect
them by implication, according to the best of my understanding,
and as the election of the new Minister
Plenipotentiary was on the fourteenth of September, and the Alliance
sailed from Boston the fourteenth of January, and in
this space of four months no notice appears to have been
taken of me, I think the only inference that can be made
is, that Congress have no further service for me on this
side the water, and that all my duties are on the other. I
have accordingly given notice to his Excellency, M. de
Sartine, and to his Excellency the Minister Plenipotentiary
here, of my intentions to return, which I shall do by the
first frigate that sails for any part of the United States,
unless I should receive counter orders in the meantime.
In a matter of so much uncertainty, I hope I shall not incur
the disapprobation of Congress, even if I should not judge
aright of their intentions, which it is my desire as well as
my duty to observe, as far as I can know them.</p>

<p>By the papers enclosed with this, Congress will perceive
the discontented and tumultuous state of the three kingdoms
of England, Scotland, and Ireland, which is so great
and so rapidly increasing, that the United States will have
little to fear from reinforcements of their enemies the ensuing
campaign. All their forces will be necessary to keep
in order their own riotous populace, and to replace those
which are daily consuming in the West Indies. There is,
however, no prospect of their evacuating either New York
or Rhode Island. The possession of those places is so
indispensable for the preservation of their West India and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
other trade, as well as of their other dominions in America,
that nothing but the last necessity will induce them to
give them up.</p>

<p>The greatest source of danger and unhappiness to the
States then probably will be a depreciating currency.
The prospect of a loan in Europe, after every measure
that has been or could be taken, I think it my duty to say
frankly to Congress, is very unpromising. The causes of
this are very obvious, and cannot be removed; the state of
our country itself, and the course of exchange, would be
sufficient to discourage such a loan, if there were no other
obstruction, but there are many others. There are more
borrowers in Europe than lenders, and the British loan itself
will not be made this year at a less interest than seven
and a half per cent.</p>

<p>I see no hope of relief, but from economy and taxation,
and those I flatter myself will be found sufficient, if the
people are once convinced of the necessity of them.
When a people are contending not only for the greatest
object, that any people ever had in view, but for security
from the greatest evil that any nation ever had to dread,
(for there is at this hour no medium between unlimited
subjugation to Parliament and entire sovereignty) they
must be destitute of sense as well as of virtue, if they are
not willing to pay sufficient sums annually to defray the
necessary expense of their defence in future, supported as
they are by so powerful an ally, and by the prospect of
others, against a kingdom already exhausted, without any
ally at all, or a possibility of obtaining one. As this is the
first time I have had the honor to address myself to Congress,
since we received the news of your Excellency's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
appointment to the chair, you will please to accept of my
congratulations on that event.</p>

<p>
I have the honor to be, with the highest esteem, &amp;c.</p>

<h3>TO JOHN JAY, PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">
Passy, March 1st, 1779.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,
</p>

<p>My last letter to Congress was on the twentyseventh of
last month; since which an account of the new loan is
received from London, and as this may, perhaps, afford to
Congress the clearest proof of the weakness of their enemies,
it is of importance, that it should be transmitted to
them. Some accounts say, that the loan is to be seven
millions, others eight. The conditions of the loan are, in
general, the established interest of three per cent, an annuity
for three and three quarters per cent for twentynine
years, and seven lottery tickets for every thousand pounds.</p>

<p>In one account the advantages are thus stated.</p>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td align="left">100 3 per cent,</td><td align="right">¬£61 00 00</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">¬£3 15s. annuity for twentynine years, at twelve years' purchase,</td><td align="right">45 00 00</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Two fifths of a year's interest and annuity, gained by both beginning from the 5th of January,</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;although the money is paid monthly, and not ended until December,</td><td align="right">2 14 00</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">¬£3 premium of seven lottery tickets for each ¬£1000, gives for each hundred,</td><td align="right">2 2 00</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">&nbsp;</td><td align="right">________</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">For each ¬£100 paid, there is received</td><td align="right">¬£110 16 00</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>This statement for the first year is pretty accurate.
Another account makes it ten and one quarter per cent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
for the first year. The subsequent years, however it
will not be so much. Yet for all the subsequent years,
during the term of the annuity, it will be six and three
quarters per cent. Upon the whole, it is generally looked
upon as good as seven and a half per cent. In a country
where the highest interest, that is tolerated by the standing
laws, is five per cent, this is a terrible symptom.</p>

<p>While this system has any credit among the money
lenders in Holland, Switzerland, Geneva, &amp;c. Congress
will perceive, that there is little hope of procuring a private
loan for the United States from any of those places.
Whether any may be procured from any State, or Prince,
time must discover.</p>

<p>
I have the honor to be, &amp;c.</p>

<h4>Translation.</h4>

<p class="letter_head">
St Germain, April 9th, 1779.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Dear Sir,
</p>

<p>I beg leave to apply to you, in an instance where I am
much concerned. The case I shall lay before you, and
recommend to your care. There is an officer in Paris,
whom I wish to send over to America on board the Alliance,
and who I know would be of service in the American
army. For that reason, besides his recommendations,
I have a great regard for him. I wish the gentleman may
find a passage in the frigate. Dr Franklin cannot officially
send an officer, but I beg you would take him along with
you, as I take upon myself the charge of presenting him
to Congress. All the marks of kindness I ever met with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
from them, and the knowledge which the strictest friendship
has given me of General Washington's sentiments, make
me as certain as possible, that my officer will meet with
the best reception in Philadelphia and in the army, who
know I am acquainted with what may be convenient to
them.</p>

<p>It is with a great concern, that I hear of discontents between
Captain Landais and his officers, and I flatter myself,
that you will again establish harmony and concord
among them. I will take the opportunity of this frigate to
write over to my friends in America.</p>

<p>The articles alluded to in your letter from Passy, I have
been very busy about, but I did not meet with great success
till now, and what is done is not equal to what I could
wish. It is true, our circumstances are rather narrow at
this moment, and I believe, that the Ministers are willing
to do what they think possible, or advantageous, but we do
not always agree in opinion. I hope, however, America
will have more and more occasions of knowing the true
attachment of this nation for her.</p>

<p>With great impatience I wait for your answer, that I
may send the officer to Nantes. I hope you will not refuse
your patronage on this occasion, and I may answer
Congress will have no objection to take a gentleman whom
I send them. You will, my dear Sir, in settling his passage,
much oblige your humble servant,</p>

<h3>TO ARTHUR LEE.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">
L'Orient, June 9th, 1779</p>

<p class="letter_open">Dear Sir,
</p>

<p>Your favors of June the 2d and 5th are now before me;
that of the 29th of March I have answered, if I ever received
it, for I have answered every one I have received
from you, but not having my papers at hand cannot be
particular. I thank you for the manuscript and the pamphlet.</p>

<p>I am happy to hear from you, and from all others, so
agreeable a character of the Chevalier de la Luzerne, and
M. Marbois, the last of whom I have had the pleasure to
see.</p>

<p>I wish it was in my power to do more for Mr Ford, and
to take him with me, but the frigate will be so crowded, I
fear it will be impossible.</p>

<p>The declarations of the northern powers against the
right of England to stop their merchant vessels, and arming
to support their rights, are important events. The
displacing of Mr Paine is a disagreeable and alarming
one.</p>

<p>It is with no small astonishment, that I learn by your
letter of the 5th, that by advices from America since your
last to me, your enemies are determined to impeach your
attachment to our country and her cause. Your request
that I would give my opinion on that subject, from the
knowledge I have had of your conduct, while we acted in
commission together, can meet with no objection from me.
But I hope I need not inform you, that my opinion upon
this point is no secret at Versailles, Paris, Nantes, or elsewhere.
Enclosed is a copy of a letter I did myself the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
honor to write to his Excellency the Count de Vergennes
some time ago, which, for anything I know, is communicated
to all the Court, but the answer shows that it was
received. I had my reasons then for keeping it to myself,
which exist now no more. I would transcribe the whole
correspondence if it was in my power, but I have not
time, and it is sufficient to say, that it was conducted by
his Excellency with the most obliging politeness. It is my
duty now to furnish you with a copy, lest any accident
may befal me, which is by no means improbable. I
thought then, and am confirmed in that opinion more and
more, that it was my duty to communicate my sentiments
at Court, upon that very extraordinary occasion, and from
regard to my own reputation, I am very glad you have
given me an opportunity of furnishing you with evidence,
that I did this part of my duty so far forth. The letter
was written, sent to Versailles, and received by his Excellency
before the arrival of the Marquis de Lafayette, his
Aid-de-Camp, or Dr Winship; that is, before the news
reached Passy of the new arrangement.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> But lest that
letter should not be sufficient, I shall enclose another certificate,
not without a heartfelt grief, that malice should
have been so daring and so barbarous, as to make either
such a letter or such a certificate from me either necessary
or even pardonable.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> Your hint, that I must correct some
things that are amiss, extorts from me an involuntary sigh.
I shall be in a situation critical and difficult without example,
my own character at stake from various quarters, and
without anything to support me but truth and innocence,
and you need not be informed, that these are not always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
sufficient. I have little expectation of doing good; God
grant I may do no harm. I shall not designedly. But I
suppose Congress intend to examine me as a witness, and
I must tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the
truth, as far as I know it. If the task should end here, I
should not be much embarrassed, but if they should proceed
to demand of me opinions and judgments of men and
things, as there is reason to expect they will, although I
hope they will not, what will be the consequences? Upon
the whole, truth must be my shield, and if the shafts of
interested malice can pierce through this, they shall pierce
me.</p>

<h3>TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">
Braintree, August 3d, 1779.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,
</p>

<p>On the 27th of February, I had the honor of writing to
Congress, informing them of my intention of returning
home, in consequence of the commission which superseded
mine. On the first of March, I had again the honor
of writing some information concerning the unprecedented
interest, which the British Government are obliged to give
for the loan of money for the service of the present year.
On the 8th of March, I took my leave of the American
Minister, and left Paris for Nantes, in expectation of there
meeting the Alliance, and sailing in her for America in a
few weeks. Upon my arrival at Nantes, I learned the
Alliance was yet at Brest, and so embarrassed with nearly
forty prisoners, who were supposed to have been concerned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
in a conspiracy to carry her to England, and with other
difficulties, that it was uncertain when she would be ready.</p>

<p>The agent at Nantes at this time receiving a letter from
his Excellency, Dr Franklin, desiring him to consult me
about the direction of the Alliance, I thought it would expedite
the public service for me to make a journey to
Brest, about two hundred miles, which I undertook accordingly,
and arrived at that port without loss of time.
There, after an attendance of some weeks, and much negotiation
with the Commandant, Intendant, and Agent, all
things were prepared for the frigate to sail for Nantes, with
about one hundred British prisoners, to be exchanged for
a like number of American prisoners, arrived there from
England in a cartel. I returned to Nantes, and the Alliance
in a few days arrived in the river, the prisoners were
exchanged, about sixty enlisted in the Alliance, and the
rest in the Poor Richard, Captain Jones.</p>

<p>After accommodating all the difficulties with the British
prisoners, the American prisoners, the officers and crew of
the Alliance, and supplying all their necessary wants, Captain
Landais, having orders to sail for America, and everything
ready to proceed to sea in a few days, received unexpected
orders to proceed to L'Orient, and wait there for
further orders. I had the honor of a letter at the same
time from his Excellency, enclosing one from the Minister
of Marine, by which I learned, that the King had been
graciously pleased to grant me a passage on board the
frigate, which was to carry His Majesty's new Minister
Plenipotentiary to the United States, that the frigate was
at L'Orient, and that the Minister would be there in a few
days. I went in the Alliance from Nantes to L'Orient,
where after some time the frigate, the Sensible, arrived,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
but his Excellency, the Chevalier de la Luzerne, did not
arrive until the 10th of June. On the 14th of June, and
not before, I had the pleasure to be under sail, and on the
3d of August, arrived in Nantasket Roads.</p>

<p>I have entered into this detail of disappointments to justify
myself for not returning sooner, and to shew that it was not
my fault, that I was not at home in eight weeks from the
first authentic information, that I had nothing further to do
in France. There is nothing remaining for me to do but
to settle my accounts with Congress; but as part of my
accounts are in conjunction with my late colleagues, with
whom I lived in the same house during my residence in
Paris, I am not able to judge whether Congress will
choose to receive my accounts, or to wait until the other
Commissioners shall exhibit theirs, and have the whole
together, under one view, so as to do equal justice to all.
I am ready, however, to render all the account in my power,
either jointly or separately, whenever Congress shall
order it, and I shall wait their directions accordingly.</p>

<p>It is not in my power, having been so long from Paris,
to give Congress any news of importance, except that the
Brest fleet, under the Count d'Orvilliers, was at sea the
beginning of June, that Admiral Arbuthnot was at Plymouth
the 31st of May, and that there was a universal persuasion,
arising from letters from Paris and London, that Spain
had decided against the English. The Chevalier de la Luzerne
will be able to give Congress satisfactory information
upon this head.</p>

<p>I ought not to conclude this letter, without expressing
my obligations to Captain Chavagne, and the other officers
of the Sensible, for their civilities in the course of my passage
home, and the pleasure I have had in the conversation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
of his Excellency, the new Minister Plenipotentiary from
our august ally, and the Secretary to the embassy, Monsieur
Marbois.</p>

<p>The Chevalier de la Luzerne is a Knight of the Order
of St John of Jerusalem, of an ancient and noble family,
connected by blood with many characters of principal
name in the kingdom, a grandson of the celebrated Chancellor
de la Moignon, a nephew of Monsieur Malesherbes,
perhaps still more famous as first President of the Court of
Aids and as a Minister of State, a brother to the Count de
la Luzerne, and of the Bishop of Sangres, one of the three
Dukes and Peers who had the honor to assist in the consecration
of the King, a near relation of the Marc√©hal de
Broglie and the Count his brother, and of many other
important personages in that country. Nor is his personal
character less respectable than his connexions, as he is
possessed of much useful information of all kinds, and particularly
of the political system of Europe, obtained in his
late embassy in Bavaria; and of the justest sentiments of
the mutual interests of his country and ours, and of the
utility to both of that alliance, which so happily unites them,
and at the same time divested of all personal and party
attachments and aversions. Congress and their constituents,
I flatter myself, will have much satisfaction in his negotiations,
as well as in those of the Secretary to the
embassy, who was recently Secretary to the embassy
in Bavaria, and who is a counsellor of the Parliament of
Metz, a gentleman whose abilities, application, and disposition
cannot fail to make him useful in the momentous
office he sustains.</p>

<h3>TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">
Braintree, August 4th, 1779.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,
</p>

<p>At the close of the service on which Congress have
done me the honor to send me, it may not be amiss to
submit a few remarks to their consideration on the general
state of affairs in Europe, as far as they relate to the interests
of the United States. As the time approaches,
when our relations with the most considerable States in
Europe will multiply and assume a greater stability, they
deserve the attention of Americans in general, but especially
of those composing their supreme council.</p>

<p>France deserves the first place among those powers,
with which our connexions will be the most intimate, and
it is with pleasure I am able to assure Congress, that from
the observations I have made during my residence in that
Kingdom, I have the strongest reasons to believe, that
their august ally, his Ministers, and nation, are possessed
of the fullest persuasion of the justice of our cause, of the
great importance of our independence to their interests,
and the firmest resolution to preserve the faith of treaties
inviolate, and to cultivate our friendship with sincerity and
zeal. This is of the more consequence to us, as this
power enjoys in Europe at this hour an influence, which it
has not before experienced for many years.</p>

<p>Men are so sensible of a constant tendency in others to
excesses, that a signal superiority of power never appears,
without exciting jealousies and efforts to reduce it. Thus,
when Spain, under Charles the Fifth and his successor,
made herself dangerous, a great part of Europe united
against her, assisted in severing the United Provinces from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
her, and by degrees greatly diminished her power. Thus,
when France, under Lewis the Fourteenth, indulged the
spirit of conquest too far, a great part of mankind united
their forces against her, with such success as to involve her
in a train of misfortunes, out of which she never emerged
before the present reign. The English, in their turn, by
means of their commerce and extensive settlements abroad,
arose to a degree of opulence and naval power, which excited
more extravagant passions in her own breast, and
more tyrannical exertions of her influence, than appeared
in either of the other cases. The consequence has been
similar, but more remarkable. Europe seems to be more
universally and sincerely united in the desire of reducing
her, than they ever were in any former instance. This is
the true cause why the French Court never made war with
so universal a popularity among their own subjects, so general
an approbation of other Courts, and such unanimous
wishes among all nations for her success, as at this time.</p>

<p>The personal character of the King, his declared patronage
of morals and economy, and the great strokes of wisdom,
which have marked the commencement of his reign,
the active spring which has been given to commerce by
the division of the British empire, and our new connexions
with his subjects; all these causes, together with the
two treaties of peace, which have been lately signed under
his auspices and his mediation, have given to this power
a reputation, which the last reign had lost.</p>

<p>The first of these treaties has determined those controversies,
which had for a long time divided Russia and the
Porte, and the parties have been equally satisfied with the
conditions of their reconciliation, a circumstance the more
honorable for the French Ministry, and the Chevalier de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
St Priest, their Ambassador at Constantinople, as it is uncommon.
The ancient confidence of the Porte in the
Court of Versailles has revived, and the coolness, or
rather enmity, which divided France and Russia for near
twenty years, gives place to a friendship, which is at this
time in all its fervor, and will probably be durable, as
these powers have no interest to annoy each other, but, on
the contrary, are able to assist each other in a manner the
most essential.</p>

<p>The peace of Germany, signed at Teschin, the 13th of
last May, has not equally satisfied the belligerent powers,
who were on the one part the Emperor, and on the other,
the King of Prussia and the Elector of Saxony his ally.</p>

<p>From the multitudes of writings, which have appeared
before and during this war, in which the causes, the motives,
and the rights of it are discussed, it appears, that in
1768, at the extinction of one of the branches of the
House of Bavaria, which has been separated from its
trunk for near five centuries, the House of Austria thought
itself able, and priests and lawyers among their own subjects
were complaisant enough to tell her, that she had a
right to put herself in possession of the best part of the
patrimony of the extinguished line.</p>

<p>The King of Prussia, to whose interest this augmentation
of power would have been dangerous, has crowned an
illustrious reign, by displaying all the resources of military
genius and profound policy in opposition to it. While he
contended in the field, France negotiated, and the work,
begun by his arms, was completed by the cabinet of Versailles.</p>

<p>The Palatine House of Bavaria, the Duke of Deux
Ponts, and particularly the Elector of Saxony, have obtained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
all they could reasonably demand, and the empire
has preserved its balance of power in spite of its head.
The King of Prussia had covered himself with glory, to
which he put the finishing stroke, by not demanding any
compensation for the expenses of the war. All parties
have been satisfied except the Emperor, who has disordered
his finances, ruined his Kingdom of Bohemia with
immense fines, has not obtained any advantage over his
adversary, and consequently has destroyed among his
own troops the opinion they had of their superiority, and,
in fine, has sustained a loss the most sensible for a young
Prince just beginning to reign, the reputation of justice
and moderation. It is the influence, the address, and
ability of the French Minister, joined to the firmness of
Russia, which have completed this work; and Lewis the
Sixteenth has restored in Germany to the nation over
which he reigns, that reputation which his grandfather had
lost.</p>

<p>The merit of the Chevalier de la Luzerne, who was Ambassador
in Bavaria during the transaction of this business,
and that of M. Marbois, the Secretary to that embassy,
in accomplishing an affair of such importance, which was
rendered peculiarly delicate by the late family connexion
between the Courts of Vienna and Versailles, was probably
a motive for sending them now to America, a mission
of no less importance and no less delicacy.</p>

<p>It is not probable, however, that they could have succeeded
so soon, if England could have afforded subsidies
to the Emperor. The Revolution in America, in which
the French King has taken an earlier and a greater part
than any other Sovereign in Europe, has operated so as to
conciliate to him a consideration that is universal. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
new Minister will give to Congress information the most
precise in this respect, and touching the part which Spain
is taking at this time, for which reason I shall refrain from
entering into it, and content myself with observing, that all
these considerations ought to induce us to cherish the alliance
of France; and that every good citizen of the United
States ought to endeavor to destroy the remains of those
prejudices, which our ancient rulers have endeavored to
inspire us with; that we have nothing to fear and much
to hope from France, while we conduct ourselves with
good sense and firmness, and that we cannot take too much
pains to multiply the commercial relations, and strengthen
the political connexions between the two nations; provided
always, that we preserve prudence and resolution
enough to receive implicitly no advice whatever, but to
judge always for ourselves, and to guard ourselves against
those principles in government, and those manners, which
are so opposite to our own Constitution and to our own
characters, as a young people, called by Providence to the
most honorable and important of all duties, that of forming
establishments for a great nation and a new world.</p>

<p>In the opinion of some, the power with which we shall
one day have a relation the most immediate, next to that
of France, is Great Britain. But it ought to be considered,
that this power loses every day her consideration,
and runs towards her ruin. Her riches, in which her
power consisted, she has lost with us, and never can
regain. With us she has lost her Mediterranean trade,
her African trade, her German and Holland trade, her
ally, Portugal, her ally, Russia, and her natural ally, the
House of Austria; at least, as being unable to protect
these as she once did, she can obtain no succor from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
them. In short, one branch of commerce has been lopped
off after another, and one political interest sacrificed
after another, She resembles the melancholy spectacle of
a great wide spreading tree, that has been girded at the
root. Her endeavors to regain these advantages, will continually
keep alive in her breast the most malevolent passions
towards us. Her envy, her jealousy, and resentment,
will never leave us, while we are what we must unavoidably
be, her rivals in the fisheries, in various other
branches of commerce, and even in naval power. If
peace should unhappily be made, leaving Canada, Nova
Scotia, or the Floridas, or any of them, in her hands, jealousies
and controversies will be perpetually arising. The
degree, therefore, of intercourse with this nation, which
will ever again take place, may justly be considered as
problematical, or rather the probability is, that it will
never be so great as some persons imagine; moreover, I
think that every citizen in the present circumstances, who
respects his country, and the engagements she has taken,
ought to abstain from the foresight of a return of friendship
between us and the English, and act as if it never was
to be.</p>

<p>But it is lawful to consider, that which will probably be
formed between the Hollanders and us. The similitude
of manners, of religion, and in some respects of constitution,
the analogy between the means by which the two
republics arrived at independency, but above all the attractions
of commercial interest, will infallibly draw them together.
This connexion will not probably show itself,
before a peace or a near prospect of peace. Too many
motives of fear or interest place the Hollanders in a dependance
on England, to suffer her to connect herself openly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
with us at present. Nevertheless, if the King of Prussia,
could be induced to take us by the hand, his great influence
in the United Provinces might contribute greatly to
conciliate their friendship for us. Loans of money, and
the operations of commercial agents or societies, will be
the first threads of our connexions with this power. From
the essays and inquiries of your Commissioners at Paris,
it appears, that some money may be borrowed there, and
from the success of several enterprises by the way of St
Eustatia, it seems that the trade between the two countries
is likely to increase, and possibly Congress may think
it expedient to send a Minister there. If they should, it
will be proper to give him a discretionary power to produce
his commission or not, as he shall find it likely to
succeed, to give him full powers and clear instructions
concerning the borrowing of money; and the man himself
above all should have consummate prudence, and a caution
and discretion, that will be proof against every trial.</p>

<p>If Congress could find any means of paying the interest
annually in Europe, commercial and pecuniary connexions
would strengthen themselves from day to day, and if the
fall of the credit of England should terminate in bankruptcy,
the Seven United Provinces, having nothing to dissemble,
would be zealous for a part of those rich benefits, which
our commerce offers to the maritime powers, and by an
early treaty with us secure those advantages, from which
they have already discovered strong symptoms of a fear of
being excluded by delays. It is scarcely necessary to observe
to Congress, that Holland has lost her influence in
Europe to such a degree, that there is little other regard
for her remaining but that of a prodigal heir for a rich
usurer, who lends him money at a high interest. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
State which is poor and in debt has no political stability.
Their army is very small, and their navy is less. The
immense riches of individuals may possibly be in some
future time the great misfortune of the nation, because the
means of defence are not proportioned to the temptation
which is held out for some necessitous, avaricious, and formidable
neighbor to invade her.</p>

<p>The active commerce of Spain is very inconsiderable;
of her passive commerce, we shall not fail to have a part;
the vicinity of this power, her forces, her resources, ought
to make us attentive to her conduct, but if we may judge
of the future by the past, I should hope we had nothing to
fear from it. The genius and interest of the nation incline
it to repose. She cannot determine upon war but in the
last extremity, and even then she sighs for peace. She is
not possessed of the spirit of conquest, and we have reason
to congratulate ourselves, that we have her for the nearest
and principal neighbor. Her conduct towards us at this
time will perhaps appear equivocal and indecisive, her determinations
appear to be solely the fruit of the negotiations
of the Court of Versailles. But it ought to be considered,
she has not had motives so pressing as those of
France to take in hand our defence. Whether she has an
eye upon the Floridas, or what other terms she may expect
from Congress, they are no doubt better informed than I
am. To their wisdom it must be submitted to give her
satisfaction, if her terms are moderate, and her offers in
proportion. This conduct may conciliate her affection and
shorten delays, a point of great importance, as the present
moment appears to be decisive.</p>

<p>Portugal, under the administration of the Marquis de
Pombal, broke some of the shackles by which she was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
held to England. But the treaty, by which a permanent
friendship is established between the Crowns of Spain and
Portugal, was made in 1777, an event that the English
deplore as the greatest evil, next to the irrecoverable loss
of the colonies, arising from this war, because they will
now no longer be able to play off Portugal against Spain,
in order to draw away her attention as well as her forces,
as in former times. But as Portugal has not known how
to deliver herself entirely from the influence of England,
we shall have little to hope from her; on the other hand,
such is her internal weakness, that we have absolutely nothing
to fear. We shall necessarily have commerce with her,
but whether she will ever have the courage to sacrifice
the friendship of England for the sake of it is uncertain.</p>

<p>It would be useless to consider that infinite number of
little sovereignties into which Germany is divided, and develope
all their political interests. This task is as much
beyond my knowledge as it would be useless to Congress.
They will have few relations friendly or hostile with this
country, excepting in two branches of commerce, that of
merchandise and that of soldiers. The latter, infamous and
detestable as it is, has been established between a nation,
once generous, humane, and brave, and certain princes, as
avaricious of money as they are prodigal of the blood of
their subjects; and such is the scarcity of cash, and the
avidity for it in Germany, and so little are the rights of
humanity understood and respected, that sellers will probably
be found as long as buyers. America will never be
found in either class. The State of Germany, with which
we may have commerce of an honorable kind, is the
House of Austria, one of the most powerful in Europe.
She possesses very few countries, however, near the sea.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
Ostend is the principal city, where she might have established
a trade of some consequence, if the jealousy of the
maritime Powers had not constantly opposed it. France,
Spain, Holland, and England, have been all agreed in their
opposition, and the treaty of Utrecht, ratified more than
once by subsequent treaties, has so shackled this port, that
it will be impossible to open a direct trade to it, without
some new treaty, which possibly may not be very distant.
England may possibly make a new treaty with Austria, and
agree to privileges for this port, in order to draw away the
advantages of the American trade from France and Spain;
and in such a treaty Holland may possibly acquiesce, if not
accede to it. The port of Trieste enjoys liberty without
limits, and the Court of Vienna is anxious to make its
commerce flourish. Situated as it is at the bottom of the
Gulf of Trieste, the remotest part of the Gulf of Venice,
tedious and difficult as the navigation of those seas is, we
could make little use of it at any time, and none at all while
this war continues.</p>

<p>This Court would seize with eagerness the advantages,
that are presented to her by the independence of America,
but an interest more powerful restrains her, and although
she is certainly attentive to this revolution, there is reason
to believe she will be one of the last powers to acknowledge
our independence. She is so far from being rich,
that she is destitute of the means of making war without
subsidies, as is proved by the peace which has lately been
made. She has occasion for the succors of France or of
England to put in motion her numerous armies. She conceives
easily, that the loss of the resources and credit of
the English has disabled them to pay the enormous subsidies,
which, in former times, they have poured into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
Austrian coffers. She sees therefore with a secret mortification,
that she shall be hereafter more at the mercy of
France, who may choose her ally, and prefer at her pleasure
either Austria or Prussia, while neither Vienna nor
Berlin will be able, as in times past, to choose between Paris
and London, since the latter has lost her past opulence
and pecuniary resources. It is our duty to remark these
great changes in the system of mankind, which have already
happened in consequence of the American war. The
alienation of Portugal from England, the peace of Germany,
and that between Petersburg and Constantinople,
by all which events England has lost, and France gained,
such a superiority of influence and power, are owing entirely
to the blind division of that policy and wealth, which
the English might have still enjoyed, from the objects of
their true interests and honor, to the ruinous American
war.</p>

<p>The Court of Berlin flatters itself, that the connexions
which have heretofore so long united France and Prussia
will renew themselves sooner or later. This system is more
rational than that which subsists at this day. The king of
Prussia may then wait without anxiety the consequences of
the present revolution, because it tends to increase the
resources of his natural ally. The jealousy between the
Emperor and the King of Prussia, and that between the
Houses of Bourbon and Austria, are a natural tie between
France and Prussia. The rivalry between France and
Great Britain is another motive, too natural and too permanent
for the former to suffer the King of Prussia to be long
the ally of the latter. One of the favorite projects of Prussia,
that of rendering the port of Emden a place of flourishing
trade, interests him most powerfully in our independence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
Silesia, one of his best provinces, has already felt
the influence of it, and, sensible of the force that empires
derive from commerce, he is earnestly desirous to see it
introduced between America and his States; which gives
ground to believe, that as Austria will be one of the last so
Prussia will be one of the first to acknowledge our independence;
an opinion which is rendered more probable by
the answer, which was given by the Baron de Schulenburg
to Mr Arthur Lee, and the influence of the King of Prussia
in the United Provinces, which is greater than that of any
other Power, arising from his great military force, and the
vicinity of his dominions. His near relation to the Stadtholder
and the Prince of Brunswick, is an additional motive
to cultivate his friendship. The Electorate of Saxony, with
a fruitful soil, contains a numerous and industrious people,
and most of the commerce between the east and the west
of Europe passes through it. The fairs of Leipsic have
drawn considerable advantages for these four years from our
trade. This Power will see with pleasure the moment,
which shall put the last hand to our independence. The
rest of Germany, excepting Hamburgh and Bremen, have
no means of opening a direct commerce with us; with the
latter we have no connexion at present; in the former all
the commerce of Lower Germany is transacted; here we
shall soon have occasion to establish an agent or consul.</p>

<p>Poland, depopulated by the war and a vicious government,
reduced by a shameful treaty to two thirds of her
ancient dominion, destitute of industry and manufactures,
even of the first necessity, has no occasion for the productions
of America. Dantzic sees her ancient prosperity
diminish every day. There is, therefore, little probability
of commerce, and less of any political connexion between
that nation and us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>Russia, Sweden, and Denmark, comprehended under
the denomination of the northern powers, have been
thought by some to be interested in our return to the domination
of Great Britain. Whether they consider themselves
in this light or not, their late declarations against the
right of England to interrupt their navigation, and their
arming for the protection of their commerce on the ocean,
and even in the English channel, are unequivocal proofs of
their opinion concerning the right in our contest, and of
their intentions not to interfere against us. It is very true,
that the articles of commerce which they produce, are in
many respects the same with those of America. Yet if
we consider that we shall have occasion to purchase from
them large quantities of hemp and sailcloth, and that our
productions of timber, pitch, tar, and turpentine, are less profitable
with us without bounties, than some other branches
of labor, it is not probable that we shall lower the price of
these articles in Europe so much as some conjecture, and
consequently our increased demand upon those countries
for several articles will be more than a compensation to
them for the small loss they may sustain, by a trifling reduction
in the price of those articles. It is not probable
that the Courts of Petersburg, Stockholm, and Copenhagen
have viewed with indifference the present revolution, if
they have been apprehensive of being hurt by it in some
respects, which however I think must have been a mistaken
apprehension; yet the motive of humbling the pride of the
English, who have endeavored to exercise their domination,
even over the northern seas, and to render the Danish
and Swedish flag dependent on theirs, has prevailed over
all others, and they are considered in Europe as having
given their testimony against the English in this war.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>Italy, a country which declines every day from its ancient
prosperity, offers few objects to our speculations.
The privileges of the port of Leghorn, nevertheless, may
render it useful to our ships, when our independence shall
be acknowledged by Great Britain, if, as we once flattered
ourselves, the Court of Vienna might receive an American
Minister. We were equally in error respecting the Court
of the Grand Duchy of Tuscany, where an Austrian prince
reigns, who receives all his directions from Vienna, in such
a manner that he will probably never receive any person
in a public character, until the chief of his house has set
him the example. The King of the two Sicilies is in the
same dependence on the Court of Madrid, and we may
depend upon it, he will conform himself to all it shall suggest
to him. This prince has already ordered the ports of
his dominions to be open to American vessels, public and
private, and has ordered his Ambassador at Paris to apply
to your Commissioners for a description of the American
flag, that our vessels might be known, and receive no molestation
upon their appearance in his harbors.</p>

<p>The Court of Rome, attached to ancient customs, would
be one of the last to acknowledge our independence, if we
were to solicit for it. But Congress will probably never
send a Minister to his Holiness, who can do them no service,
upon condition of receiving a Catholic Legate or Nuncio
in return, or in other words, an ecclesiastical tyrant,
which it is to be hoped the United States will be too wise
ever to admit into their territories.</p>

<p>The States of the King of Sardinia are poor, and their
commerce is very small. The little port of Villa Franca
will probably see few American vessels, nor will there be
any close relations, either commercial or political, between
this prince and us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>The republic of Genoa is scarcely known at this day in
Europe, but by those powers who borrow money. It is
possible that some small sums might be obtained there, if
Congress would fall upon means of insuring a punctual
payment of interest in Europe.</p>

<p>Venice, heretofore so powerful, is reduced to a very inconsiderable
commerce, and is in an entire state of decay.</p>

<p>Switzerland is another lender of money, but neither her
position nor her commerce can occasion any near relation
with us.</p>

<p>Whether there is anything in these remarks worth the
trouble of reading, I shall submit to the wisdom of Congress,
and subscribe myself, with the highest consideration, your
most obedient and humble servant,</p>

<h3>TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">
Braintree, September 10th, 1779.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,
</p>

<p>Looking over the printed journals of the 15th of last
April, I find in the report of the Committee appointed to
take into consideration the foreign affairs of the United
States, and also the conduct of the late and present Commissioners
of these States, the two following articles.</p>

<p>1. "That it appears to them, that Dr Franklin is Plenipotentiary
for these States at the Court of France; Dr
Arthur Lee, Commissioner for the Court of Spain; Mr
William Lee, Commissioner for the Courts of Vienna and
Berlin; Mr Ralph Izard, Commissioner for the Court of
Tuscany; that Mr John Adams was appointed one of the
Commissioners at the Court of France, in the place of Mr
Deane, who had been appointed a joint Commissioner
with Dr Franklin and Dr Arthur Lee, but that the said
commission of Mr Adams is superseded by the Plenipotentiary
commission to Dr Franklin.</p>

<p>2. "That in the course of their examination and inquiry,
they find many complaints against the said Commissioners,
and the political and commercial agency of Mr
Deane, which complaints, with the evidence in support<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
thereof, are herewith delivered, and to which the Committee
beg leave to refer."</p>

<p>The word "said" in the second article, refers to the
Commissioners mentioned in the first, and as my name is
among them, I learn from hence, that there were some
complaints against me, and that the evidence in support of
them was delivered to Congress by the Committee.</p>

<p>I therefore pray, that I may be favored with copies of
those complaints, evidences, and the names of my accusers,
and the witnesses against me, that I may take such
measures as may be in my power to justify myself to
Congress.</p>

<p>I had yesterday the honor of your letter of the 7th of

on my return to my family and country.</p>

<p>The reason why my letters of the 27th of February,

America, but were disappointed of passages, until the

<h3>TO JAMES LOVELL.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">
Braintree, October 17th, 1779.</p>

<p class="letter_open">My Dear Sir,
</p>

<p>What shall I say to your favors of the 27th and 28th of
September, which came by the last post? The unanimity
of my election surprises me, as much as the delicacy, importance,
and danger of the trust distress me. The
appointment of Mr Dana to be Secretary pleases me
more than my own to be Minister, Commissioner, Negotiator,
call it what you will. I have communicated to him
your letters in confidence, and all other material intelligence
I had, and hope he will not decline, but you know
the peculiarities of his situation, and if he should refuse, I
hope you will not force your name out of nomination
again. I did not suppose that such characters would be
willing to go as Secretaries, because I did not know your
plan, otherwise I should not have mentioned Mr Jennings
to Mr Gerry for one to Dr Franklin. Your mastery of
the language, and your indefatigability, would make you
infinitely useful in any of these departments.</p>

<p>I rejoice that you produced my letter to the Count de
Vergennes and his answer before the choice, because it
contained a testimony in favor of Mr Lee, which was his
due.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> I am very much affected at his recall, because I
know his merit, and, therefore, I am glad I was not placed
in his stead, for suspicions would have arisen, and reflections<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
would have been cast upon me, as having favored his
removal in order to make room, which I certainly did not.
I am infinitely obliged to you for those letters, and for that
received the post before last, but I really tremble for your
health. Let me entreat you, for the sake of our country,
to take care of it. If I was to apply myself as you do,
I should soon go to study politics in another sphere. Yet
I am so selfish as to beg the continuance of your favors to
me, and I pledge myself to you, I will not be in debt any
more than may be made by the intrinsic difference in the
value of the letters, which will be unavoidable.</p>

<p>I thank you for the extract from Mr Izard's letter. I
am not a little surprised at its contents. It was written, I
see, to his friend, and I suppose intended in confidence.
I am fully persuaded he did not intend, that the whole
should have been laid before Congress.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> I utterly deny
that I ever used to him any such language, as the indecent
paragraph that closes what he says about me. Indeed, that
is manifestly his own inference, and in his own words, from
what he says he had heard me say, and he draws the same
from what Dr Franklin and Mr Deane had said upon the
same subject. I further deny that I ever <em>threatened</em> him
with the displeasure of Congress, for writing his opinion
concerning these articles to Congress, or for suggesting
them to the Commissioners. But to enter into all the
conversations that have passed between Mr Izard and me
respecting those articles, and many other points in order to
give a full and fair representation of those conversations,
would fill a small volume. Yet there never was any angry
or rude conversation between him and me, that I can
recollect. I lived with him on good terms, visited him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
and he me, dined with his family, and his family with me,
and I ever told him, and repeated it often, that I should be
always obliged to him for his advice, opinions, and sentiments
upon any American subject, and that I should always
give it its due weight, although I did not think myself
bound to follow it any further than it seemed to me to be just.
As Congress have declined giving me the charges against
me by their authority, and have, upon the whole, acquitted
me with so much splendor, it would look like a littleness
of soul in me to make myself anxious, or give them any
further trouble about it. And as I have in general so good
an opinion of Mr Izard's attachment to his country, and of
his honor, I shall not think myself bound to take any further
notice of this fruit of his inexperience in public life,
this peevish ebullition of the rashness of his temper. I
have written a few other observations to Mr Gerry on the
same subject. You and he will compare these with them
for your private satisfaction, but be sure that they are not
exposed where they will do harm to the public, to Mr
Izard, or me, unnecessarily.</p>

<p>If I should go abroad, cannot you lend me twenty or
thirty complete sets of the journals? They are much
wanted in Europe. A set of them is a genteel present,
and perhaps would do me and the public more service
than you are aware of. If Congress, or some Committee
would order it, I should be very glad.</p>

<p>
I am, &amp;c.</p>

<h3>TO SAMUEL HUNTINGTON, PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">
Braintree, October 19th, 1779.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,
</p>

<p>I had in Paris an opportunity of procuring information
concerning the British whale fishery on the coast of Brazil,
which it is proper to communicate to Congress, that if any
advantage can be made of it the opportunity may not be
lost.</p>

<p>The last year and the year before the English carried
on this fishery to very great advantage, off the river Plate
in South America, in the latitude of 35¬∞ south, and from
thence to 40¬∞, just on the edge of soundings, off and on, as
the sailors express it, and about longitude 65¬∞ from London.
They had about seventeen vessels in this fishery, which all
sailed from London in the months of September and October.
All the officers and men Americans from Nantucket
and Cape Cod, two or three from Rhode Island, and one
from Long Island. Four or five of these vessels went to
Greenland, to which place they sail yearly, the last of
February or the beginning of March.</p>

<p>The year before last, there was published in the English
newspapers, a letter from the Lords of the Admiralty to
Dennis de Bredt, in Coleman Street, informing him, that a
convoy should be appointed to the Brazil fleet. But this I
had certain information was a forgery, calculated merely to
deceive American privateers, and no convoy actually went
or was appointed, either last year or the year before, although
the imposture was repeated both times, and will no
doubt be renewed this.</p>

<p>For the capture or destruction of a fishery so wholly defenceless,
not one of the vessels having any arms, a single<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
frigate, or indeed a privateer of four and twenty guns, would
be sufficient. The beginning of December would be the
best time to proceed from Boston or Philadelphia, because
the frigate would then find the whaling vessels nearly loaded.
The cargoes of bone and oil are very valuable, and at least
four hundred and fifty of the best kind of seamen would be
taken out of the hands of the English, and might be gained
into the American service. Most of the officers and men
wish well to this country, and would gladly be in its service,
if they could be delivered from that they are engaged in.
Whenever the English men of war or privateers, have
taken an American vessel, they have given to all the whalemen
found among the crew, by order of government, their
choice, either to go on board a man of war and fight against
their country, or into the whale fishery. Such numbers
have chosen the latter, as have made up the crews of
seventeen vessels.</p>

<p>I thought it my duty to communicate this, that if so profitable
a branch of commerce, and so valuable a nursery of
seamen, can be taken from the English, it may be done.
I prevailed with my colleagues last year to represent these
facts to his Excellency, M. de Sartine, but it appears that
his Majesty's service would not admit of any enterprise
from France in consequence of it. Since my return I
have represented them to the Council of this State, but
whether anything can be done by them, after the disaster at
Penobscot, I doubt. If Congress should not deem it consistent
with the public service to send a frigate upon this
service, nothing will be lost but the trouble of this letter.</p>

<p>I have the honor to congratulate your Excellency on
your advancement to the chair, and to subscribe myself
with great respect, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,
</p>

<p>M. Schweighauser of Nantes, who is a native of Switzerland,
observing me as I was one day at his house looking
with some attention upon a stamp of the heroic deed of William
Tell, asked me to take a few of them to America, as a
present from him, which I agreed to do with pleasure. He
accordingly sent on board the frigate a box containing, as
he told me, one stamp for each State, neatly framed and
glazed, which he desired me to present to Congress, as a
small token of his respect. The box has never been opened,
but I hope the pictures are safe, and with permission
of Congress I will deliver it to the Navy Board in Boston,
to be by them transmitted to the delegates from the several
States, or to their order.</p>

<h3>TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">
Braintree, October 21st, 1779.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,
</p>

<p>So many advantages might be derived to the United
States in the conduct of the war, in furnishing the army
and navy, in augmenting the value, or at least in preventing
the further depreciation of their currency, in lowering
the prices of goods, in supplying the wants of the people,
and in preventing murmurs and discontents, that I have
ever thought it of very great importance, in some way or
other, to procure convoys to their trade, to and from the
West India Islands, and Europe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>France and Spain have such advantages of England in
carrying on the war in the American seas, and would receive
such assistance from our commerce, privateers, and
growing navy, that I have ever thought it a main principle
of their policy to maintain a constant and decided superiority
of naval power in the West Indies, and upon the
coasts of this continent. I would, therefore, with due deference
to the superior wisdom of Congress, beg leave to
submit to their consideration, whether it would not be expedient
for them, either by a direct representation from
themselves to the French and Spanish Courts, or by instructions
to their Plenipotentiary Ministers, to convince
those Courts, that their true interest lies in adopting this
plan. It is certainly their interest, reasoning upon French
and Spanish principles simply, to conduct this war in such
a manner as has a tendency in the shortest time, and with
the least expense, to diminish the power of their enemies,
and increase their own. Now I would submit it to Congress
whether it may not be easily demonstrated, that these
ends may be obtained the most easily in this way. A representation
from Congress, either directly or by instructions
to their Ministers, showing what assistance in provisions,
artists, materials, vessels of war, privateers, land
armies, or in any other way, France and Spain might depend
upon receiving from these States, either for money or
as the exertions of an ally, would have great weight.</p>

<p>Much has been already said to the French Ministry
upon these subjects, and not wholly without effect; yet
much more may be said to greater advantage, and perhaps
to better purpose, for they are extremely well disposed to
do what can be made to appear to them for the advantage
of the common cause.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>I have the honor to enclose some papers on this subject.
One is a letter from the Commissioners to his Excellency
the Count de Vergennes, which he received the beginning
of January last,<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> the other is a letter from me to the Marquis
de Lafayette<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> in February, with his answer.</p>

<h3>TO HENRY LAURENS.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">
Braintree, October 25th, 1779.</p>

<p>My Dear Sir,
</p>

<p>Your favor of the 4th of this month gave me great
pleasure, but I am afraid that you and some others of my
friends felt more for me in the awkward situation you
mention than I did for myself, though I cannot say that I
was wholly insensible. I could compare it to nothing, but
Shakspeare's idea of Ariel, wedged in the middle of a
rifted oak, for I was sufficiently sensible, that it was owing
to an unhappy division in Congress, and pains enough
were taken to inform me, that one side were for sending
me to Spain, and the other to Holland, so that I was flattered
to find that neither side had any decisive objection
against trusting me, and that the apparent question was
only <em>where</em>.</p>

<p>That I was sent without the least solicitation of
mine, directly or indirectly, is certainly true; and I had
such formidable ideas of the sea and of British men of
war, such diffidence in my own qualifications to do service
in that way, and such uncertainty of the reception I
should meet, that I had little inclination to adventure.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
That I went against my interest is most undoubtedly so,
for I never yet served the public without losing by it. I
was not, however, as you suppose, kept unemployed. I
had business enough to do, as I could easily convince you.
There is a great field of business there, and I could easily
show you that I did my share of it. There is so much to
do, and so much difficulty to do it well, that I am rejoiced
to find a gentleman of such abilities, principles, and activity
as Colonel Laurens undoubtedly is, without a compliment,
appointed to assist in it.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> I most sincerely hope for
his friendship, and an entire harmony with him, for which
reason I should be very happy in his company in the passage,
or in an interview with him as soon as possible in
Europe. He will be in a delicate situation, but not so
much so as I was; and plain sense, honest intentions, and
common civility will, I think, be sufficient to secure him,
and do much good.</p>

<p>Your kind compliments on my safe return and most
honorable re-election are very obliging. I have received
no commission, nor instructions, nor any particular information
of the plan; but from the advice and information
from you and several other of my friends at Philadelphia
and here, I shall make no hesitation to say, that, notwithstanding
the delicacy and danger of this commission, I
suppose I shall accept it without delay and trust events
to Heaven, as I have been long used to do.</p>

<p>The convulsions at Philadelphia are very affecting and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
alarming, but not entirely unexpected to me. The state of
parties, and the nature of their government, have a long
time given me disagreeable apprehensions. But I hope
they will find some remedy. Methods will be found to
feed the army, but I know of none to clothe it without
convoys to trade, which Congress, I think, will do well to
undertake, and persuade France and Spain to undertake
as soon as possible. Your packets for your friends in Europe
will give me pleasure, and shall be forwarded with
care and despatch.</p>

<p>
With great truth and regard, I am, &amp;c.</p>

<h3>TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">
Braintree, November 4th, 1779.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,
</p>

<p>I had yesterday the honor of receiving your letter of the
20th of October, enclosed with two commissions, appointing
me Minister Plenipotentiary from the United States, to
negotiate peace and commerce with Great Britain, together
with instructions for my government in the execution
of these commissions, copies of instructions to the
Ministers Plenipotentiary at Versailles and Madrid, and
two acts of Congress of the 4th and 15th of October.</p>

<p>Peace is an object of such vast importance, the interests
to be adjusted in the negotiations to obtain it are so complicated
and so delicate, and the difficulty of giving even
general satisfaction is so great, that I feel myself more distressed
at the prospect of executing the trust, than at the
thought of leaving my country, and again encountering the
dangers of the seas and of enemies. Yet, when I reflect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
on the general voice in my favor, and the high honor that
is done me by this appointment, I feel the warmest sentiments
of gratitude to Congress, and shall make no hesitation
to accept it, and devote myself without reserve or loss
of time to the discharge of it. My success, however,
may depend, in a very great degree, on the intelligence
and advices that I may receive from time to time from
Congress, and on the punctuality with which several articles
in my instructions may be kept secret. It shall be
my most earnest endeavor to transmit to Congress the
most constant and exact information in my power of whatever
may occur, and to conceal those instructions, which
depend in any measure on my judgment. And I hope I
need not suggest to Congress the necessity of communicating
to me, as early as possible, their commands from
time to time, and of keeping all the discretionary articles
an impenetrable secret, a suggestion, however, that the
constitution of that sovereignty, which I have the honor to
represent, might excuse.</p>

<p>As the frigate has been some time waiting, I shall embark
in eight or ten days at furthest. Your Excellency
will please to present my most dutiful respects to Congress,
and accept my thanks for the polite and obliging
manner in which you have communicated their commands.</p>

I have the honor to be, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="center">INSTRUCTIONS FOR A TREATY OF PEACE WITH GREAT
BRITAIN.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,</p>

<p>You will herewith receive a commission, giving you full
power to negotiate a treaty of peace with Great Britain, in
doing which you will conform to the following information
and instructions.</p>

<p>1. The United States are sincerely desirous of peace,
and wish by every means, consistent with their dignity and
safety, to spare the further effusion of blood. They have,
therefore, by your commission and these instructions,
labored to remove the obstacles to that event, before the
enemy have evidenced their disposition for it. But as the
great object of the present defensive war, on the part of
the allies, is to establish the independence of the United
States, and as any treaty whereby this end cannot be obtained
must be only ostensible and illusory, you are, therefore,
to make it a preliminary article to any negotiation,
that Great Britain shall agree to treat with the United
States, as sovereign, free, and independent.</p>

<p>2. You shall take especial care also, that the independence
of the said States be effectually assured and confirmed
by the treaty or treaties of peace, according to the
form and effect of the treaty of alliance with His Most
Christian Majesty. And you shall not agree to such treaty
or treaties, unless the same be thereby so assured and confirmed.</p>

<p>3. The boundaries of these States are as follows, viz.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
These States are bounded north, by a line to be drawn
from the northwest angle of Nova Scotia along the highlands,
which divide those rivers which empty themselves
into the river St Lawrence, from those which fall into the
Atlantic ocean, to the northwesternmost head of Connecticut
river; thence down along the middle of that river to
the fortyfifth degree of north latitude; thence due west in
the latitude fortyfive degrees north from the equator to the
northwesternmost side of the river St Lawrence or Cadaraqui;
thence straight to the south end of Nepissing; and
thence straight to the source of the river Mississippi; west,
by a line to be drawn along the middle of the river Mississippi
from its source to where the said line shall intersect
the thirtyfirst degree of north latitude; south, by a line to
be drawn due east, from the termination of the line last
mentioned in the latitude of thirtyone degrees north from
the equator to the middle of the river Appalachicola, or
Catahouchi; thence along the middle thereof to its junction
with the Flint river; thence straight to the head of
St Mary's river; and thence down along the middle of
St Mary's river to the Atlantic ocean; and east, by a line
to be drawn along the middle of St John's river from its
source to its mouth in the Bay of Fundy, comprehending
all islands within twenty leagues of any part of the shores
of the United States, and lying between lines to be drawn
due east from the points where the aforesaid boundaries
between Nova Scotia on the one part, and East Florida
on the other part, shall respectively touch the Bay of Fundy
and the Atlantic ocean. You are, therefore, strongly to
contend that the whole of the said countries and islands
lying within the boundaries aforesaid, and every citadel,
fort, post, place, harbor, and road to them belonging, be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
absolutely evacuated by the land and sea forces of his
Britannic Majesty, and yielded to the powers of the States
to which they respectively belong, in such situation as
they may be at the termination of the war. But, notwithstanding
the clear right of these States, and the importance
of the object, yet they are so much influenced by
the dictates of religion and humanity, and so desirous of
complying with the earnest request of their allies, that if
the line to be drawn from the mouth of the lake Nepissing
to the head of the Mississippi cannot be obtained without
continuing the war for that purpose, you are hereby empowered
to agree to some other line between that point
and the river Mississippi; provided the same shall in no
part thereof be to the southward of latitude fortyfive degrees
north. And in like manner, if the eastern boundary
above described cannot be obtained, you are hereby
empowered to agree, that the same shall be afterwards
adjusted, by commissioners to be duly appointed for that
purpose, according to such line as shall be by them settled
and agreed on, as the boundary between that part of the
State of Massachusetts Bay, formerly called the province
of Maine, and the colony of Nova Scotia, agreeably to
their respective rights. And you may also consent, that
the enemy shall destroy such fortifications as they may
have erected.</p>

<p>3. Although it is of the utmost importance to the peace
and commerce of the United States that Canada and Nova
Scotia should be ceded, and more particularly that their
equal common right to the fisheries should be guarantied
to them, yet a desire of terminating the war has induced
us not to make the acquisition of these objects an ultimatum
on the present occasion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>5. You are empowered to agree to a cessation of hostilities
during the negotiation, provided our ally shall consent
to the same, and provided it shall be stipulated that
all the forces of the enemy shall be immediately withdrawn
from the United States.</p>

<p>6. In all other matters not abovementioned, you are to
govern yourself by the alliance between His Most Christian
Majesty and these States, by the advice of our allies, by
your knowledge of our interests, and by your own discretion,
in which we repose the fullest confidence.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p class="center">INSTRUCTIONS FOR A TREATY OF COMMERCE WITH
GREAT BRITAIN.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,</p>

<p>You will herewith receive a commission, giving you full
power to negotiate a treaty of commerce with Great Britain,
in doing which, you will consider yourself bound by
the following information and instructions.</p>

<p>1. You will govern yourself principally by the treaty of
commerce with His Most Christian Majesty, and as, on
the one hand, you shall grant no privilege to Great Britain
not granted by that treaty to France, so, on the other, you
shall not consent to any peculiar restrictions or limitations
whatever in favor of Great Britain.</p>

<p>2. In order that you may be the better able to act with
propriety on this occasion, it is necessary for you to know,
that we have determined, 1st, that the common right of
fishing shall in no case be given up; 2dly, that it is essential
to the welfare of all these United States that the inhabitants
thereof, at the expiration of the war, should continue
to enjoy the free and undisturbed exercise of their common
right to fish on the Banks of Newfoundland, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
other fishing banks and seas of North America, preserving
inviolate the treaties between France and the said States;
3dly, that application shall be made to His Most Christian
Majesty to agree to some article or articles for the better
securing to these States a share in the said fisheries; 4thly,
that if, after a treaty of peace with Great Britain, she shall
molest the citizens or inhabitants of any of the United
States, in taking fish on the banks and places hereinafter
described, such molestation, being in our opinion a direct
violation and breach of the peace, shall be a common cause
of the said States, and the force of the union be exerted to
obtain redress for the parties injured; and 5thly, that our
faith be pledged to the several States, that, without their
unanimous consent, no treaty of commerce shall be entered
into, nor any trade or commerce carried on with Great
Britain, without the explicit stipulation hereinafter mentioned.
You are therefore not to consent to any treaty of
commerce with Great Britain without an explicit stipulation
on her part, not to molest or disturb the inhabitants of
the United States of America in taking fish on the Banks
of Newfoundland and other fisheries in the American seas
anywhere, excepting within the distance of three leagues
of the shores of the territories remaining to Great Britain
at the close of the war, if a nearer distance cannot be obtained
by negotiation. And in the negotiation you are to
exert your most strenuous endeavors to obtain a nearer
distance to the gulf of St Lawrence, and particularly along
the shores of Nova Scotia, as to which latter we are desirous
that even the shores may be occasionally used for the
purpose of carrying on the fisheries by the inhabitants of
these States.</p>

<p>In all matters you are to govern yourself by your own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
discretion, as shall be most for the interest of these States,
taking care that the said treaty be founded on principles of
equality and reciprocity, so as to conduce to the mutual
advantage of both nations, but not to the exclusion of
others.</p>

<p class="letter_head">
Braintree, November 7th, 1779.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,
</p>

<p>I have the honor to enclose to Congress a copy of the
letter book of the Commissioners at the Court of Versailles,
during the time I had the honor to be one of them. As
the letter book was kept by me, and almost wholly in my
hand writing, the Minister Plenipotentiary consented, that I
should bring it home with me, leaving him a copy, which
was done.</p>

<p>As there may be many things in it which Congress may
have occasion to know, I have prevailed with Mr Thaxter
to copy it. I shall submit to the consideration of Congress,
whether he ought to have any allowance for this service,
and how much. As Mr Thaxter will accompany me to
Europe, in the character of my private Secretary, if Congress
think proper to allow him anything for these copies,
I can pay him in Europe if it is thought proper.</p>

<p>I chose to mention Mr Thaxter's going with me to Congress,
because jealousies have arisen heretofore concerning
private Secretaries. Mr Thaxter is known to Congress,
and I think I can safely confide in his fidelity, diligence,
and discretion, and from the experience I have had in Europe
I am fully convinced, that it is my duty to take with
me some one of this character.</p>

<h3>TO B. FRANKLIN.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">
Ferrol, December 8th, 1779.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,
</p>

<p>I have the honor to inform your Excellency, that, Congress
having judged it proper to appoint me to a new mission
in Europe, I embarked on the 13th of November, at
the instance of the Chevalier de la Luzerne and M. Gerard,
on board the same frigate, that carried me to America.
Soon after we got to sea, a formidable leak in the ship discovered
itself, so as to oblige us to keep two pumps constantly
going by night and day, which induced the captain
to think it necessary to put into this place, where we have
just now cast anchor. Whether I shall go to Paris by land
or wait for the frigate is uncertain; I believe the former,
as the latter might detain me four or five weeks. I have
despatches for your Excellency from Congress, which I
shall carry with me, and newspapers. These latter contain
little remarkable save the evacuation of Rhode Island
by the enemy, and the Count d'Estaing's progress in Georgia,
in co-operation with General Lincoln, which was in a
fair course of success.</p>

<p>I hope the Confederacy, which sailed from Philadelphia
three or four weeks before us, with M. Gerard and Mr
Jay, who is appointed Minister Plenipotentiary for Spain,
has happily arrived, and made it unnecessary for me to enlarge
upon the general state of affairs in America, which
were upon the whole in a favorable train. I hope to have
the honor of saluting you at Passy in a few weeks, and am,
with great respect, Sir, your most obedient humble servant,</p>

<p class="letter_head">
Ferrol, December 11th, 1779.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,
</p>

<p>I have the honor to inform Congress, that on the 13th
of November I embarked on board the French frigate,
la Sensible, and on the 14th came on board Mr Francis
Dana, the Secretary to my commission, when we fell
down to King's Roads, and on the 15th we sailed for
France.</p>

<p>A leak was soon discovered in the ship, which obliged
us to ply the pumps; as it seemed a steady leak, it gave
little alarm at first, but continuing to increase to such a
degree as to make two pumps constantly necessary night
and day, obliging the passengers to take their turns in
common with the ship's people, the captain judged it
necessary to make the first port he could find. Accordingly,
on the 7th of December, we happily discovered
Cape Finisterre, and on the 8th arrived in the magnificent
Spanish port of Ferrol, where we found a squadron of
French ships of the line, the officers of which think we
were very happy in making this port, as the frigate, since
she has been in this harbor, is found to make seven or
eight feet of water an hour.</p>

<p>The advice of all the gentlemen here is to make the
best of my way to Paris by land, as it is the opinion of
many, that the frigate will be condemned, but if not, she
certainly will not be ready to sail again from this port in
less than four or five weeks.</p>

<p>This is unfortunate to me, because, by all the information
I can obtain, travelling in this kingdom is attended
with many difficulties and delays, as well as a very great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
expense, there being no regular posts as in France, and
no possibility of passing over the mountainous part of this
country in carriages.</p>

<p>I find there has been no engagement in the European
seas between the English and the combined fleets of
France and Spain, as was reported in America. There
has been an epidemic sickness on board the French fleet,
which caused it to return rather sooner than was intended.
There are twentyfive Spanish ships of the line in Brest
harbor with the French. It is reported that M. du Chaffault
is appointed commander in chief of the French fleet,
and that the Count d'Orvilliers has retired.</p>

<p>Captain Jones has done another brilliant action, by
taking a fortyfour gun ship, after an obstinate engagement,
which he carried into the Texel, but I cannot learn the
particulars with much certainty or exactness.</p>

<p>I have been treated with the utmost attention and politeness
since my arrival in this place, both by the Spanish
and French officers, particularly by the Spanish Lieutenant
General of Marine, Don Joseph St Vincent, who is
commander in chief of the marine, by M. de Sade, the
French <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chef d'Escadr√©</i>, and by the French consul and
vice consul, who have all obligingly offered me every assistance
in their power.</p>

<p>I shall endeavor to inform Congress of every step of my
progress, as I may find opportunity. I have heard nothing
as yet, which makes it probable to me, that I shall
have anything to do openly and directly, in pursuance of
my commission very speedily. There is a confused rumor
here of a mediation of Russia and Holland, but I am
persuaded without foundation. It seems to be much more
certain, that the English continue in their old ill humor and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
insolent language, notwithstanding their impotence grows
every day more apparent.</p>

<p>I have the honor to be, &amp;c.</p>

<h3>TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">
Corunna, December 16th, 1779.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,
</p>

<p>By the opportunity of a small vessel accidentally in this
harbor, bound to Newburyport, I have the honor to inform
Congress that I have been detained by violent rains, and
several accidents, in Ferrol until yesterday, when I set out
with my family for this place, and arrived last evening
without any accident. I awaited immediately on the Governor
of the province, and on the Governor of the town,
and received many civilities from both, and particularly
from his Excellency the Governor of the province of Galicia,
an assurance that he was not only disposed personally
to render me every hospitality and assistance in his power,
but that he had received express orders from his Court,
to treat all Americans who should arrive here like their
best friends. These personages were very inquisitive
about American affairs, particularly the progress of our
arms, and the operations of the Count d'Estaing, and more
particularly still about the appointment of a Minister Plenipotentiary
to the Court of Madrid. They requested his
name, character, nativity, age, whether he was a member
of Congress, and whether he had been President, with
many other particulars.</p>

<p>To all these questions I made the best answers in my
power, and with regard to his Excellency, the Minister<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
Plenipotentiary at the Court of Madrid, I gave them the
most exact information, and such a respectable character
as the high offices he has sustained, and his own personal
merit require. It is the prevailing opinion here, that the
Court of Madrid is well disposed to enter into a treaty
with the United States, and that the Minister from Congress
will be immediately received, American independence
acknowledged, and a treaty concluded. The frigate
la Sensible is found to be in so bad a condition, that
I am advised by everybody to go to France by land. The
season, the roads, the accommodations for travelling are so
unfavorable, that it is not expected I can get to Paris in
less than thirty days. But if I were to wait for the frigate,
it would probably be much longer. I am determined,
therefore, to make the best of my way by land. And it is
possible that this journey may prove of some service to
the public, although it will be tedious and expensive to me,
at least, I hope the public will sustain no loss by it.</p>

<p>There are six battalions of Irish troops in Spain, in
three regiments, several of whose officers have visited me
to assure me of their regard to the United States. I have
been this afternoon to the Tower de Fer to see the Island
of Cezarga, which was rendered famous in the course of
the last summer by being appointed the rendezvous of the
French and Spanish fleets. The French fleet arrived at
this Island on the 9th of June last, but were not joined by
the Spanish fleet from Ferrol, till some time in July, nor
by the fleet from Cadiz till much later, so that the combined
fleets were not able to sail for the English Channel,
until the 30th of July. To prevent a similar inconvenience
another campaign, there are about twentyfive Spanish
ships of the line now in Brest, which are to winter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
there, and to be ready to sail with the French fleets the
approaching summer, at the first opening of the season.</p>

<p>God grant them success and triumph, although no man
wishes for peace more sincerely than I, or would take
more pleasure, or think himself more highly honored in
being instrumental in bringing it about, yet, I confess, I see
no prospect or hope of it, at least before the end of
another summer. America will be amused with rumors of
peace, and Europe too, but the English are not yet in a
temper for it.</p>

<p>The Court of Russia has lately changed its Ambassador
at the Court of London, and sometime in the month
of October, M. Simolin, the new Minister Plenipotentiary
from the Court of Petersburg to the Court of London,
passed through France in his way to England, and resided
three weeks in Paris. From this circumstance, a report
has been spread in Europe, that the Court of Russia is
about to undertake the office of mediator between the
belligerent powers. But from conversation with several
persons of distinction since my arrival in Spain, particularly
with the Count de Sade, the Chef d'Escadr√©, commanding
the French men of war now in Ferrol, I am
persuaded, that if Russia has any thoughts of a mediation,
the independence of the United States will be insisted
upon by her as a preliminary, and Great Britain will feel
much more reluctance to agree to this, than to the cession
of Gibraltar, which it is said Spain absolutely insists upon.</p>

<p>I have the honor to be, &amp;c.</p>

</p>

<p>Mr Adams presents his compliments to the Governor of
Corunna, and informs him, according to his desire expressed
last evening, that the names of the persons for whom
he requests a passport from his Excellency, the Governor
of this Province, are as follows.</p>

<p>John Adams, a Minister Plenipotentiary from the United
States of America.</p>

<p>Francis Dana, Secretary to Mr Adams's commission, a

<p>John Quincy Adams, a son of Mr Adams, about twelve
years of age.</p>

<p>Charles Adams, another son of Mr Adams, nearly ten
years of age.</p>

<p>Jeremiah Allen of Boston, in Massachusetts, a private
gentleman accidentally in company; he is a merchant
travelling with the view of establishing a private commerce
in Spain, as well as France.</p>

<p>Samuel Cooper Johonnot, ten or eleven years of age, a
grandson of a particular friend of Mr Adams in Boston,
going to Paris for an education in the University there.</p>

<p>Joseph Stevens, a servant of Mr Adams.</p>

<p>John William Christian Frieke, a servant of Mr Dana.</p>

<p>Andrew Desmia, a servant of Mr Allen.</p>

<p>Mr Adams requests a passport for all these persons to
go to Madrid, and from thence to Bilboa, and from thence
to Bayonne, in their way to Paris; with liberty at the same
time to go directly to Bayonne by the nearest road, without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
going to Madrid, or to Bilboa; as it is uncertain
whether Mr Adams will have the time to gratify his inclination

<h3>TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">
Bilboa, January 16th, 1780.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,
</p>

<p>I have the honor to inform Congress, that last night, and
not before, I arrived at this place.</p>

<p>At Ferrol and Corunna I was advised by all the friends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
of America, to undertake a journey by land. The consul
of France and M. Lagoanere, a gentleman who has acted
for some time as the American agent at Corunna, obligingly
offered me all the assistance in their power, and accordingly
used their utmost diligence to procure me the necessary
mules and carriages, for the transportation of the small number
of persons in company with me, and the small quantity
of baggage we found it indispensably necessary to take with
us, having left more than two thirds of what we had with
us to take the chance of a passage by sea to France.
From the 8th of December, when we arrived at Ferrol, to
the 26th of the same month, when we set off from Corunna,
we were detained by the violent rains, and the impossibility
of getting accommodations for travelling. All
our beds and provisions we were obliged to carry with us.
We travelled through the ancient kingdoms of Galicia,
Leon, Old Castile, and Biscay, and although we made the
best of our way without loss of time, we found it impossible
to go more than eight leagues a day, and sometimes not
more than four. The roads and inns are inconvenient to
a degree that I should blush to describe, and the pain we
suffered in a cold season of the year for want of fire, in a
country where there are no chimnies, gave us all such violent
colds, that I was under great apprehensions of our
being seized with fevers.</p>

<p>As we were so near Madrid, within about forty leagues,
I balanced some time in my own mind, whether to go to
that fine city, but considering that this would lengthen our
journey near a hundred leagues, the severe season of the
year, and above all the political situation that I might be in,
my country not being yet acknowledged as a sovereign
State by any formal act of that Court, it being known, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
another gentleman had a commission for that Court, and he
being expected soon to arrive, I thought it upon the whole
the least hazardous to the public interest to avoid that route.</p>

<p>It may be of some use to my countrymen to transmit a
few observations upon the country I have passed through,
because it appears to me that a commerce extremely advantageous
to both countries may be opened between us and
Spain, as soon as our independence shall be acknowledged
by that power, at least as soon as we shall obtain the great
object of all our wishes, peace.</p>

<p>The province of Galicia is one of the largest in Spain,
and said to be one of the best peopled. Corunna is in
effect the principal city, although St Jago, in respect to its
patron Saint, or more probably to the Archbishop who
resides there, is in name the capital. This province, one
of those whereof the ancient Crown of Castile was formed,
is washed by the ocean for more than seventy leagues from
Ribadeo, on the frontiers of Asturias, to the mouth of the
river Minks, which separates it from Portugal. This coast,
which is divided by Cape Finisterre, is provided on both
sides of the Cape with ports equally safe and convenient,
which nature seems to have prepared around this Cape,
an object oftentimes so necessary to be made by navigators,
both at their departure from Europe, and at their return,
as so many asylums both from the apprehensions and
the consequences of storms. The most known of these
ports are Ribadeo, Ferrol, Corunna, and Camarinas, to
the eastward of Cape Finisterre; Corubios, Muros, Pontevidia,
and Vigo to the westward; all proper to receive vessels
of the first rate, especially Ferrol and Vigo; the first,
the most considerable department of the marine of Spain,
is embellished with everything that art and the treasures,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
profusely spent upon it for thirty years past, could add to
its happy situation. Vigo, represented to be one of the
most beautiful ports in the world, is another department of
the marine, more extensive and proper, for such an establishment
than Ferrol itself. Besides these ports, there are
a multitude of harbors and bays round Cape Finisterre,
which afford a safe and convenient shelter to merchant
vessels. With all these advantages for foreign commerce,
this province has very little but what is passive. It receives
from abroad some objects of daily consumption,
some of luxury, some of convenience, and some even of
the first necessity. At present it offers little for exportation
to foreign countries. The Sardin√© of its coast, the
famous fish which it furnishes to all Spain, the cattle which
it fattens for the provision of Madrid, and a few coarse linens
which are its only manufacture, and are well esteemed, are
the objects of its active commerce, and form its balance
with the other provinces. The wine and the grain, the
chief productions of its lands, seldom suffice for its consumption,
and never go beyond it.</p>

<p>The liberty of commerce with the Windward Islands,
granted by the Court within a few years, and the particular
establishment of &mdash;&mdash; opened the ports of that part of the new
world to this province; and although without manufactures
herself, or any of those productions proper for America,
she renders to foreign hands the product of those which
she receives from them and carries thither. In this circulation
of so many treasures, she enriches herself with parts
that she detaches from the whole.</p>

<p>The civil government of this province is formed by a
superior tribunal called the <em>Audience</em>, to which an appeal
lies from all the subaltern jurisdictions, public and private.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
This Court hears and determines, as sovereign and without
appeal, all civil affairs of a less value than a thousand ducats,
or three thousand livres. Appeals in those which
exceed that value are carried to the Chancery of Valladolid,
or to the Council of Castile. Although justice is
gratis on the part of the judges, who are paid by the government,
it is said to be not less costly, tedious, and vexatious.
It may not be useless to observe that the Criminal
Chambers, whose decrees extend to the punishment of
death, and are executed without any application to the
King or any other authority, is composed only of three
judges, and these three are the youngest of the whole tribunal,
and this order is generally followed in Spain in the
composition of the criminal tribunals, although no one pretends
to conjecture the motive of so singular a reverse of
the rational order of things. The administration of the
royal police belongs also to the Audience, and forms the
third chamber into which this tribunal is divided.</p>

<p>All the military authority, and the government of the
troops in this department, are in the hands of the Captain
General of the province. There is not any one under him
who has even the title of commandant. But in case of his
death or absence, he is succeeded by the general officer,
the most ancient in the province. To this title of Captain
General is added, commonly, that of President of the Audience,
a prerogative which, by uniting in his hands the
civil authority to all that of his place, gives a power the
most absolute and unlimited.</p>

<p>The inspection general, and all the economy of the
affairs of the King in the province, belong to the Intendant.
The different branches of the public revenue are all administered
by officers appointed by the King, as in the rest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
of the kingdom, and there are no Farmers-General as in
France. Their product is about twentysix millions of
reals, or six millions five hundred thousand livres, the expense
of collection being deducted. The expenses of the
administration, including the maintenance of three regiments
of infantry scattered about in different places, do not
exceed two millions five hundred thousand livres. The
surplus goes into the dry docks, arsenals, and fund of fortifications,
to the support of which this sum is far from
being sufficient. Such is in general the government, military,
political, and civil of this province, and nearly pf all
the others, except Biscay, Guipuscoa, and Alaba.</p>

<p>There is not in this province any particular jurisdiction
of commerce, but there is a tribunal, under the name of
the Judge Considerator of Commerce, which takes cognizance
of all their causes, civil and criminal, except the
case of contraband. At this day, the Judge Considerator
of Strangers is the governor of the province himself, and
the appeals from his judgment are carried directly to the
Council of War, which is said to be a precious privilege,
by the form and brevity of procedure compared with the
expensive and insupportable delays of the ordinary jurisdiction.</p>

<p>I cannot but think that if some measures could be taken
to convince the Court, that it is their interest to take off
the vast duties with which commerce is overloaded in this
port, fifteen per cent being to be paid upon all commodities
exported and upon all imported, and if the rigid prohibitions
of tobacco could be relaxed or repealed, several
of the productions of America would find a good market
here, and a commerce be opened that would put a new
face upon this province, and be profitable to America too.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
The conveniency of such a number of excellent ports
would be a vast advantage, which Bilboa cannot have, as
her harbor is neither safe nor convenient, besides its being
so much further down the stormy, turbulent Gulf of Biscay;
yet Biscay, which is commonly used to comprehend Biscay
proper, the principal city of which is Bilboa, although
Orduna is the capital; Guipuscoa, the capital of which is
St Sebastian, and Alaba, the capital of which is Vittoria,
three free provinces, whose laws the Kings of Spain have
hitherto been sworn to observe inviolate, have attracted
almost the whole of the American trade, because the King
has no custom house or officers here, and there are no
duties to be paid.</p>

<p>It may seem surprising to hear of free provinces in
Spain, but such is the fact, that the high and independent
spirit of the people, so essentially different from the other
provinces, that a traveller perceives it even in their countenances,
their dress, their air, and their ordinary manner
of speech, has induced the Spanish nation and her kings
to respect the ancient liberties of these people so far, that
each monarch at his accession to the throne takes an oath
to observe the laws of Biscay. The government here is
therefore diametrically opposite to that of Galicia, and the
other provinces. The King of Spain has never assumed
any higher title than Lord of Biscay. He has no troops
of any sort in the lordship, nor is there any standing array,
instead of which every man is obliged to serve in the militia.
The King has no custom house officers, nor other
revenue officers, nor any other officers whatsoever in the
lordship except a corregidor, and lately a commissary of
marine. This last is considered as an encroachment and
a grievance, and the authority of the corregidor is very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
small, as there lies an appeal from his judgment to another
tribunal, that of the two deputy generals, who are biennially
elected by the people. Few of the grandees of Spain
have any considerable estates here. The Duke of Medina
Coeli, and the Duke of Berwick, have some lands here of
no great value. The lands, generally, belong to the inhabitants
and possessors, who hold them of no lord but the
King of Spain, who is Lord of Biscay.</p>

<p>There is a Board of Trade here, which is annually instituted
by the merchants of the place, partly by lot and
partly by election, which decides all controversies arising
in trade, and all the affairs of strangers. They have never
admitted any foreign consul to reside here, although it has
been solicited by Holland, England, and France.</p>

<p>It is not at all surprising, that a constitution in its nature
so favorable to commerce, should have succeeded.</p>

<p>In travelling through the provinces of Leon and Castile,
and observing the numerous flocks of sheep, with the most
beautiful fleeces of wool in the world, I could not but wish
that some communication might be opened, by which the
United States of America might be furnished with this
necessary article from this country. There are few of our
articles of exportation but might be sent to the Spanish
market to advantage, rice, pitch, tar, turpentine, tobacco,
wheat, flour, ship timber, masts, yards, bowsprits, and salt
fish might be supplied to Spain, and at an advantage, and
in return, she might furnish us wine, oil, fruits, some silks,
some linens, perhaps, and with any quantity of wool, which
is now exported to foreign countries for manufacture, and
might as well be sent to us, but above all with silver and
gold.</p>

<p>It must be the work of time and a free intercourse between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
the two nations, and a future negotiation to ripen
these hints into a plan that may be beneficial to both.
The system of revenue, which it is dangerous and difficult
to alter in Spain, as well as in all other countries of Europe,
will be the principal objection. I have collected
together with some difficulty a few gazettes, which I have
the honor to transmit to Congress, from which all the news
may be collected that I have been able to learn. Congress
will easily perceive the eagerness with which the belligerent
powers are bent on war, without manifesting the
least disposition for peace, and most of all, Great Britain,
whose ostentatious display of trifling successes, and whose
weak exultation shows, that nothing can divert her from
her furious course. But she is exhausting and sinking her
forces every day, without gaining any lasting or solid advantage,
and she has reason to fear, from the combined
fleets of France and Spain, under such enterprising, experienced,
and approved officers, as d'Estaing and du Chaffault,
the entire ruin of her commerce and navy in the
course of a campaign or two more.</p>

<p>
I have the honor to be, &amp;c.</p>

<h3>TO THE COUNT DE VERGENNES.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">
Paris, February 12, 1780.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,
</p>

<p>Having obtained permission from your Excellency yesterday,
when I did myself the honor to wait on you at
Versailles, to write on the subject of my mission, I have
now the honor to acquaint you, that on the 29th day of
September last the Congress of the United States of
America did me the honor to elect me their Plenipotentiary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
to negotiate a peace with Great Britain, and also to
negotiate a treaty of commerce with that kingdom, and Mr
Francis Dana, member of Congress, and of the Council of
Massachusetts Bay, Secretary to both commissions.</p>

<p>As I was not at Congress when this transaction took
place, I am not able to inform your Excellency very particularly
of the rise and progress of it. But from conversation
with gentlemen at Boston, who were members of
Congress, and from private letters, I learned in general,
that it was not the result of any sudden deliberation, or the
fruit of any particular event of the war, prosperous or
adverse, but a measure that has been more than a year
under consideration, and finally agreed to on this principle,
that as it was uncertain at what time the belligerent powers
might be disposed to treat of peace, which could not be
concluded without a Minister from the United States, it
would save a great deal of time for this power to have a
Minister in Europe fully authorised to treat, and in concert
with Ministers from the other powers at war, conclude
a peace with great Britain, and a treaty of commerce consistent
with that already made with His Most Christian
Majesty, and such others as might be made with other
powers. I am persuaded it is the intention of my constituents
and of all America, and I am sure it is my own determination,
to take no steps of consequence in pursuance of
my commissions, without consulting his Majesty's Ministers.
And as various conjectures have been, and may be made
concerning the nature of my appointment and powers, and
as it may be expected by some, that I should take some
measures for announcing these to the public, or at least to
the Court of London, I beg the favor of your Excellency's
opinion and advice upon these questions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>1. Whether, in the present state of things, it is prudent
in me to acquaint the British Ministry that I am arrived
here, and that I shall be ready to treat, whenever the belligerent
powers shall be inclined to treat?</p>

<p>2. Whether it is prudent in me to publish in any manner,
more than the journals of Congress may have already
done, the nature of my mission?</p>

<p>3. Or whether to remain on the reserve, as I have
hitherto done since my arrival in Europe?</p>

<p>If any propositions should be made to me directly or
indirectly from the British Ministry, I shall not fail to communicate
them without loss of time to your Excellency,
and I beg the favor of your Excellency, as I am the only
person in Europe who has authority to treat of peace, that
if any propositions on the part of Great Britain should be
made to his Majesty's Ministers, that they may be communicated
to me, at least as far as they may relate to the
interest of the United States.</p>

<p>Although I am not confined by commissions, nor instructions,
nor by any intimations from Congress to reside
in any one place in Europe more than another, yet my
own inclinations as well as those of the public would be
most gratified, and the public service most promoted, by
my residing here. I must, therefore, request his Majesty's
protection and permission to reside in this kingdom for
some time, with or without assuming any public character,
as your Excellency may think most advisable.</p>

<p>
I have the honor to be, &amp;c.</p>

<p>When his Majesty's intentions of granting me a passage
to America were communicated to me, I had little expectation
of returning in the same frigate; but the Congress
having honored me with a fresh mission to Europe, their
Excellencies, the late and present Ministers from his Majesty
to the United States, concurred in a proposal to Congress,
and a requisition to the commander of the frigate, to
afford me a passage in her voyage home, which Captain
Chavagne agreed to with particular marks of politeness to
me and Mr Dana, and the others who accompanied me.</p>

<p>I have again to express to your Excellency the obligations
I am under to the captain, and all the officers of the
Sensible, for their goodness to me and mine. But it is
more particularly my duty to express again my thanks to
his Majesty, for this fresh favor, to M. Gerard and the

<h3>TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">
Paris, February 15th, 1780.</p>
<p class="letter_open">
Sir,
</p>

<p>I have the honor to inform Congress, that on the 9th of
this month, and not before, I had the good fortune to arrive
in this city, from Ferrol (where I arrived on the 8th of December)
with Mr Dana, Mr Thaxter, and the rest of the
company in tolerable health, after a journey of near five
hundred leagues, in the dead of winter, through bad roads,
and worse accommodations of every kind. We lost no
time more than was indispensably necessary to restore our
health, which was several times affected, and in great danger;
yet we were more than twice as long in making the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
journey by land, as we had been in crossing the Atlantic
ocean.</p>

<p>The next morning after our arrival at Paris, Mr Dana
and myself went out to Passy, and spent the day with his
Excellency Dr Franklin, who did us the honor the next
day to accompany us to Versailles, where we had the honor
to wait on their Excellencies the Count de Vergennes,
M. de Sartine, and the Count Maurepas, with each of
whom we had the honor of a short conference, upon the
state of public affairs. It is sufficient for me to say in general,
that I never heard the French Ministry so frank, so
explicit, so decided, as each of these gentlemen was in
the course of this conversation, in his declarations to persue
the war with vigor, and to afford effectual aid to the
United States. I learned with great satisfaction, that they
are sending, under convoy, clothing and arms for fifteen
thousand men to America, that seventeen ships of the line
were already gone to the West Indies, under M. de Guichen,
and that five or six more at least are to follow, in addition
to ten or twelve they have already there. I asked permission
of the Count de Vergennes to write to him on the
subject of my mission, which he cheerfully and politely
agreed to. I have accordingly written to his Excellency,
and shall forward copies of my letter and his answer, as
soon as it may be safe to do it.</p>

<p>The English are to borrow twelve millions this year, and
it is said, that the loan is filled up. They have thrown a
sop to Ireland, but have not appeased her rage. They
give out exactly such threats as they did last year, and
every other year, of terrible preparations. But Congress
knows perfectly well how these measures have been accomplished.
They will not be more fully executed the next<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
year than the last, and if France and Spain should throw
more of their force, especially by sea, into America the
next year, America will have no essential injury to fear.</p>

<p>I have learned since my arrival at Paris, with the highest
pleasure, the arrival of M. Gerard, Mr Jay, and Mr
Carmichael, at Cadiz, for whose safety we had been under
great apprehensions. I have now very solid hopes, that a
treaty will soon be concluded with Spain, hopes which
everything that I saw and heard seemed to favor.</p>

<p>The Alliance frigate, now under the command of Captain
Jones, with Captain Cunningham on board, is arrived
at Corunna, where she is to be careened, after which she
is to return to L'Orient, and from thence to go to America,
as I am informed by Dr Franklin.</p>

<p>Mr Auther Lee, and Mr Izard, are still in Paris, under
many difficulties in procuring a passage home. Mr William
Lee is at Brussels. Mr Izard has been to Holland,
to obtain a passage from thence, but unfortunately missed
his opportunity and returned disappointed.</p>

<h3>TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">
Paris, February 17th, 1780.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,
</p>

<p>It is necessary, that I should inform Congress in what
manner I have been able to procure money to defray my
expenses in my long journey, through the greatest part of
Spain and France to this city.</p>

<p>On my arrival at Ferrol, I was offered the loan of
money by the French consul, M. de Tournelle, who, at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
the same time told me, there was a gentleman at Corunna,
M. Michael Lagoanere, who had heretofore acted as an
American agent at that place, and who would be very
happy to supply me. On my arrival at Corunna, M. Lagoanere
did me the honor of a visit, and offered me every
assistance in cash, otherwise telling me at the same time,
he had some money in his hands, which he supposed belonged
to the United States, being part of the proceeds of
some prizes heretofore made by Captain Cunningham.
That this money, however, had been attached in his hands
by some Spanish merchant, who had commenced a lawsuit
against Captain Cunningham. I accordingly received
three thousand dollars for myself and Mr Dana, and a
letter of credit on the house of Cabarous at Bayonne, for
as much more as I should have occasion for. On our
arrival at Bayonne, Mr Dana and I received of that house
fifty louis d'ors, and a bill of exchange on another house of
the same name and family at Bordeaux for the like sums,
our expenses having exceeded all our computations at
Corunna, as our journey was necessarily much longer than
we expected, on account of the uncommon bad weather
and bad roads. This bill was paid upon sight. So that,
upon the whole, we have received the amount of seventeen
thousand four hundred livres, all on account of M.
Lagoanere of Corunna. Of this sum, Mr Dana has received
the amount of four thousand nine hundred and
seventyone livres and fifteen sols, and I have received
twelve thousand four hundred and twentyeight livres and
five sols, for which sums we desire to be respectively
charged in the treasury books of Congress.</p>

<p>As this money is expended, if M. Lagoanere should
draw upon us for it, all the authority we have to draw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
upon his Excellency the Minister here will not enable us
to pay it, and if M. Lagoanere should be so happy as to
avoid the attachment and leave us to account with Congress
for this money, the small sum we are empowered to
receive from his Excellency will go a very little way in
discharging our expenses. We must therefore pray, that
Congress would forward us authority to draw upon his
Excellency for the amount of our salaries annually, which,
without all doubt, will be paid.</p>

<p>I have the honor to be, with the highest respect, &amp;c.</p>

<h3>TO THE MARQUIS DE LAFAYETTE.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">
Paris, February 18th, 1780.</p>

<p class="letter_open">My Dear General,
</p>

<p>You know extremely well the skill of our enemies in
forging false news, and their artifice in circulating it, not
only through the various parts of Europe, but in the United
States of America, to keep up the spirits of their
friends and depress those of their adversaries. It is their
annual custom in the winter to send abroad large cargoes
of these lies, and they meet with a success in making them
believed, that is really astonishing.</p>

<p>Since my arrival here, I find they have been this winter
at their old game again, and have circulated reports here,
in Holland, and other parts of Europe, that they have
made new contracts with other petty Princes in Germany,
by which, together with those made before, they will be
able to draw seven thousand fresh troops from that country
to serve in America. That by appeasing the troubles
in Ireland, they shall be able to avail themselves even of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
the military associations in that kingdom, by depending
upon them for the defence of the country, and to draw near
ten thousand men from thence for the service in America.
That they have concluded a treaty with the Court of Petersburg,
by which Russia is to furnish them with twelve
ships of the line and twenty thousand men, which they say
is of the more importance, on account of the intimate connexion
between Russia and Denmark, as the latter will be
likely by this means to be drawn into the war, with their
numerous fleet of fortyfive ships of the line. The greatest
part of these tales are false. I know very well what is said
of Russia is so contrary to all that I have seen and heard
of the good understanding between Versailles and Russia,
that I have no doubt of its falsehood. But as I am very
lately arrived, and, consequently, have not opportunity to
examine these reports to the bottom, I beg the favor of
you to inform me, with all the exactness possible, how
much truth there is in them, if any at all.</p>

<p>You are very sensible that it is of the utmost importance,
that Congress should have the exactest information
of these things, and that you and I cannot render a more
useful service to our country at present, than by collecting
such intelligence with precision, and transmitting it without
delay. Knowing the pleasure you take in serving the
United States in every way in your power, I thought I
could beg this favor of you with propriety, and that you
would believe me always your friend and servant,</p>

<h3>TO M. GENET, FIRST SECRETARY FOR THE DEPARTMENT
OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">
Paris, February 18th, 1780.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Dear Sir,
</p>

<p>Whether it is, that the art of political lying is better understood
in England than in any other country, or whether
it is more practised there than elsewhere, or whether it
is accidental that they have more success in making
their fictions gain credit in the world, I know not. But it
is certain, that every winter since the commencement of
the present war with America, and indeed for some years
before, they sent out large quantities of this manufacture
over all Europe, and throughout all America, and what is
astonishing is, that they should still find numbers in every
country ready to take them off their hands.</p>

<p>Since my arrival in this city, I find they have been this
winter at their old trade, and have spread reports here and
in Holland, and in various other parts of Europe, and no
doubt they have found means to propagate them in America
too, tending to keep up the spirits of their friends, and
to sink those of their opponents. Such as, that they have
made new contracts with several German Princes, by
which they are to obtain seven thousand men to serve in
America; that they have so skilfully appeased the troubles
in Ireland, that they shall ever be able to take advantage
of the military associations there, by depending upon them
for the defence of the kingdom, while they draw from
thence ten thousand regular troops for the service in
America; that they have even concluded a treaty with
Russia, by which the Empress is to furnish them with
twelve ships of the line and twenty thousand men, as some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
say, and twenty ship of the line and twelve thousand men
as others relate. This they say is of the greater moment,
because of an intimate connexion, I know not of what
nature it is, between Russia and Denmark, by which the
latter will be likely to be drawn into the war against the
House of Bourbon and America; and Denmark, they say,
has fortyfive ships of the line.</p>

<p>I know very well that the greatest part of these reports
is false; and particularly what is said of Russia is so contrary
to all those reports, which I have heard for these
twelve months past of the harmony between Versailles and
Petersburg, that I give no credit to it at all, but I find
that all these reports make impressions on some minds,
and among the rest some Americans.</p>

<p>I therefore beg the favor of you to inform me of the
exact truth in all these matters, that I may take the earliest
opportunity of transmitting the intelligence to Congress,
where it is of importance it should be known.</p>

<p>I was much mortified when I was at Versailles the other
day, that I could not have the honor of paying my respects
to you, but I was so connected with other gentlemen, who
were obliged to return to dinner, that I could not; but I
shall take the first opportunity I can get to wait on you,
and assure you that I am, with great respect, &amp;c.</p>

<h3>M. DE LAFAYETTE TO JOHN ADAMS.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">
Paris, February 19th, 1780.</p>

<p>Dear Sir,
</p>

<p>As I came but this morning from Versailles, it was not
in my power sooner to answer the letter you have honored<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
me with, and this duty I now perform with the more pleasure,
as it is of some importance to the interests of America.
Since the first day, when I had the happiness of
making myself and of being considered in the world as
an American, I have always observed, that among the
many ways of attacking our liberties, and among the most
ungenerous ones, misrepresentations have ever been the
first weapons on which the British nation has the most
depended.</p>

<p>I am glad it is in my power generally to assure you, that
the many reports propagated by them and alluded to in
your letter are not founded upon truth. New contracts
with petty princes in Germany have not, I believe, taken
place, and if any such merchandise were sent to America,
it would at most consist of a few recruits. The troubles
in Ireland, if there is the least common sense among the
first patriots of that country, are not I hope at an end, and
it seems they now begin to raise our expectations. The
Russian troops, so much talked of in their gazettes, I take
to be mere recruits for those thirty thousand Russians, that
Mr Rivington had three years ago ordered to embark for
America.</p>

<p>Those intelligences, my dear Sir, must be counteracted
by letters to our friends in America. But as the respect,
which we owe to the free citizens of the United States,
makes it a point of duty never to deceive them, and as the
most candid frankness must ever distinguish our side of the
question from the course of tyranny and falsehood, I intend
paying tomorrow morning a visit to the Minister of
Foreign Affairs, and from him get such minute intelligence
as shall answer your purpose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>With the most sincere regard, I have the honor to
be, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="signature">
LAFAYETTE.
</p>

<p><em>P. S.</em> On my return from Versailles, my dear Sir,
where I will settle the affairs of arms that I have undertaken,
I will impart to you a project privately relating to
me, that is not inconsistent with my sentiments for our
country, America.</p>

<h3>TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">
Paris, February 19th, 1780.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,
</p>

<p>Enclosed are copies of former letters to Congress, and I
shall continue to transmit copies, until I learn that some
have arrived, for which reason I must request the favor
that his Excellency the President, or some committee,
may be desired to acknowledge the receipt of letters, so
that I may know as soon as may be, what letters have
arrived, and which have been less fortunate.</p>

<p>The art of making and spreading false news to answer
political purposes is not peculiar to Great Britain, but yet
she seems to possess this art, and the talent of giving to
her fictions the colors of probability beyond other nations;
at least, she seems to have more success in making her
impostures believed than any other. It is her annual practice
in the winter to fabricate and export large quantities of
this merchandise to all parts of Europe and America, and
she finds more customers to take them off her hands than
she ought, considering how illicit the traffic is.</p>

<p>This winter her emissaries have been more assiduous
than ever in propagating reports, that they have entered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
into new engagements with several other petty principalities
in Germany, by which they shall hire seven thousand
men, for the service of the next campaign in America.
That by compromising with Ireland, they shall be able to
take advantage even of the military associations in that
kingdom, and draw from them a large number of regular
troops for the service in America, depending on the volunteer
militia, or associators for the defence of the country;
that they have made a treaty with Russia, whereby that
power has engaged to furnish them with twelve ships of the
line and twenty thousand troops, as some say, and twenty
ships of the line and twelve thousand troops, according to
others. This alliance they say too is of the more
consequence, on account of some connexion between Russia and
Denmark, who, it is insinuated, will follow Russia into the
war, and Denmark they add has fortyfive ships of the
line, not manned it is true, but England they say can man
them.</p>

<p>These tales one would think are so extravagant and
absurd, that they would not find a believer in the world.
Yet there are persons, who believe them in all nations of
Europe, particularly in Holland, and there is no doubt the
same song will be sung in America, and many will listen to
it. There is nothing further from the truth; they will find
the utmost difficulty to draw from Germany troops enough
to repair the breaches in the German troops made in America
the last year; the same with regard to Ireland. And
as to what is said of Russia, there is not even a color of
truth in it, but on the contrary, the same good understanding
continues between Versailles and Petersburg, which
subsisted last winter, spring, and summer. As to Denmark,
I have no reason to think that she is disposed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
assist Great Britain, but on the contrary that she has armed
to defend herself at sea against Great Britain; but if it
were otherwise, to what purpose would her ships of the
line be unmanned, when Great Britain cannot man the
ships of the line she already has.</p>

<p>France seems determined to pursue the naval war with
vigor and decision in the American seas. M. de Guichen
sailed the beginning of January with seventeen or eighteen
ships of the line. Seven more are now preparing at Brest
with all possible expedition, supposed to be for America.
Those, if they all happily join the twelve ships left there by
the Count d'Estaing, will make a fleet of six and thirty ships
of the line. And the Court seems determined to maintain
the superiority in the American seas. This will give scope
to our privateers to weaken and distress the enemies of
their country, while they are enriching themselves.</p>

<p>There is no news of Admiral Rodney; from whence I
conclude he is gone to the West Indies.</p>

<p>The English have derived such a flush of spirits from
their late successes, which are mostly however of the negative
kind, that they talk in a style very different from that
of peace. There are two reflections, which the English
cannot bear, one is that of losing the domination of the
colonies as indispensable to the support of their naval superiority
over France and Spain, or either of them, in possession
of a powerful fleet at the peace. Their maxim is
to make themselves terrible at sea to all nations, and they
are convinced that if they make a peace leaving America
independent, and France and Spain powerful at sea, they
shall never again be terrible to any maritime power. These
reasons convince me, that Great Britain will hazard all
rather than make peace at present. Thompson's "Britannia,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
which expresses the feelings as well as the sentiments
of every Briton, is so much to the present purpose, that I
hope I shall be pardoned for referring to it, even in a letter
to Congress.</p>

<p>With regard to my instructions, I presume your Excellency
will not judge it proper, that I should communicate

manner, that they contain nothing inconsistent with the
letter or spirit of the treaty between his Majesty and the
United States, or the most perfect friendship between
France and America, but, on the contrary, the clearest
orders to cultivate both. I have hitherto conducted according
to your advice, having never communicated to any
person since my arrival in Europe the nature of my
mission, excepting to your Excellency and Dr Franklin, to
whom it was indeed communicated by a resolution of Congress,
and to him in confidence. I shall continue to conceal,

<p>You have been afraid to trouble the Count de Vergennes,

yourself to me, in order to know what you are to think of
several rumors, which the English have endeavored to

He has directed me to assure you, that on every occasion

them. The Count de Vergennes is likewise persuaded of
the contrary, as he is assured that no new treaty has been
negotiated with the Princes of Germany, and that no levies
are making there, but for the sake of filling up the old
ones. He does not think that the news of the treaty with
Russia, nor that which relates to the Court of Denmark,

<h3>TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">
Paris, February 20th, 1780.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,
</p>

<p>Since my arrival in Europe, I have had the mortification
to see in the public papers a series of little successes,
which our enemies have had in the prosecution of the war.
The first was a very exaggerated account in the English
Court Gazette, of their successes against the Spaniards in
South America. The next was the history of the repulse
of General Lincoln and the Count d'Estaing at Savannah,
and the raising of the siege at that post. These were soon
followed by the capture of the Spanish fleet of transport
ships by Rodney's squadron, and the advantage gained by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
that Admiral over the Spanish ships of war, after a most
gallant resistance, however, off Gibraltar.</p>

<p>These small triumphs, although chiefly of the defensive
and negative kind, and a poor compensation for the blood
and the millions they are annually wasting, are, however,
sufficient to cheer the spirits of the British populace, and
to banish from the minds of the Ministry all thoughts of
peace upon reasonable terms; for the English in the
present war act upon a maxim diametrically opposite to
that of the Romans, and never think of peace upon any
event fortunate to them, but are anxious for it under every
great adversity.</p>

<p>A report of my appointment having also been carried to
England by the cartels from Boston, and being spread in
Europe by various other ways, by passengers in the Committee,
by French passengers in the Sensible, of whom there
were a great number who had heard of it in all companies
in America, and by many private letters, and the English
ministerial writers having made use of this as evidence of
a drooping spirit in America in order to favor their loan of
money, I thought it my best policy to communicate my appointment
and powers to the French Court, and ask their
advice, as our good allies, how to proceed in the present
emergency. I accordingly wrote to his Excellency, the
Count de Vergennes, the letter of the 12th of February, a
copy of which is enclosed; and received his answer of the
15th, a copy of which is enclosed; to which I replied in a
letter of the 19th, a copy of which is also enclosed. When
I shall receive his Excellency's answer, I shall do myself
the honor to enclose that.</p>

<p>If there is anything in these letters of mine, which is not
conformable to the views and sentiments of Congress, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
wish to be instructed in it, or if Congress should not concur
with his Excellency the Count, I shall obey their
orders with the utmost punctuality and alacrity. I have
ever understood, that Congress were first advised to the
measure of appointing a Minister to negotiate peace, by the
French Minister then at Philadelphia, in the name of the
Count de Vergennes. However this may have been, it
cannot be improper to have some one in Europe empowered
to think and treat of peace, which some time or other
must come.</p>

<p>Since my last, which was of yesterday's date, I have had
opportunity to make more particular inquiries concerning
the pretended treaty with Russia, and am informed, that
the English Ministry did, not long since, make a formal application
by their Ambassador to the Empress of Russia
for a body of troops and a number of ships; but that the
application was opposed with great spirit and ability in the
Russian Council, particularly by the Minister for foreign
affairs, and rejected in council with great unanimity, and
that the harmony between Versailles and Petersburg remains
as perfect as when I left France.</p>

<p>I have the honor to be, with very great respect, &amp;c.</p>

<h3>TO JOHN JAY, MINISTER PLENIPOTENTIARY AT MADRID.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">
Paris, February 22d, 1780.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Dear Sir,
</p>

<p>I most sincerely congratulate you on your happy arrival
in Europe, which must be the more agreeable to you,
for the terrible voyages you have had. Every good
American in Europe, I believe, suffered a great anxiety<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
from the length of time that passed between the day when
it was known, that the Confederacy sailed, and the time
when the news arrived of your being in Cadiz. I, too,
have had my hairbreadth escapes, and, after my arrival, a
very tedious journey in the worst season of the year by
land. Happy, however, shall we be, if all our hazards and
fatigues should contribute to lay the foundation of a free
and prosperous people.</p>

<p>I hope no accident or disagreeable circumstance has
happened to your family, to whom I shall be obliged to
you to present my respects. From what I saw and heard
in Spain, from the strong assurances I received of the good
will of the Court and nation, and from the great attention
and respect, that were paid me by officers of government
of the highest rank in the provinces through which I
passed, I am persuaded you will meet with the most distinguished
reception, and I hope will soon have the honor
and satisfaction of concluding a treaty with Spain. You
will have the advantage of more frequent and speedy intelligence
from home, than we can have here, at least you
will have it in your power. There are vessels oftener arriving
from America at Bilboa and Cadiz, I think, than in
France. Many of these vessels come from Boston and
Newburyport, perhaps the most of them. So that by directing
your correspondents to send their letters that way,
you will have them much sooner than we can commonly
obtain them; and by transmitting yours to Messrs Gardoqui
&amp; Co. at Bilboa, and Mr Montgomery, or some other,
at Cadiz, your despatches will go more speedily, and more
safely than ours, for we find it almost impossible to get a
letter across the Bay of Biscay from France in a merchant
vessel, there are so many privateers in the route; the danger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
of whom is avoided chiefly by vessels from Bilboa
keeping near the coast, and running into harbor in case
of danger, and wholly by those from Cadiz. You will excuse
my mentioning to you this channel of intelligence,
which might not possibly have occurred to you, and my
wishing to make some advantage of it to myself, by asking
the favor of your correspondence, and that you will impart
to me the advices you may receive through it.</p>

<p>We have nothing new here at present, but what you
have had before. Pray what think you of peace? It seems
to be the will of Heaven, that the English should have
success enough to lead them on to final destruction. They
are quite intoxicated with their late advantages, although a
poor compensation for what they cost.</p>

<p>My respects to Mr Carmichael, and believe me to be,
with respect and esteem, Sir, your most obedient humble
servant,</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,
</p>

<p>Having been informed this morning by the Marquis de
Lafayette, of another opportunity for America, I have the
honor to enclose to Congress triplicates of former letters,
and copies of some other letters, which I have written and
received lately. I have also packed up all the newspapers
and pamphlets I can obtain. The <cite>Mercure de France</cite> is a
weekly publication of very ancient origin, and is become
lately very interesting to America, because those political
intelligences and speculations, which were formerly published
in another pamphlet, under the title of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Affaires de l'Angleterre
et de l'Am√©rique</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span> are now published in this, the
other having been dropped. The <cite>Courrier de l'Europe</cite>
has the most extensive circulation of any gazette, although
supposed to be rather too much under the influence of the
British Ministry sometimes; the <cite>Gazette de France</cite> is published
by authority here, and has a great reputation for integrity;
in the <cite>Gazette de la Hague</cite> the English find means
to publish many false reports. These papers and pamphlets,
together with one or two English papers, for which
I shall subscribe as soon as possible, I shall do myself the
honor to transmit to Congress constantly as they come out.
From these, Congress will be able to collect from time to
time all the public news of Europe.</p>

<p class="letter_open">
Dear Sir,
</p>

<p>You will see by the public papers, that your Committee
of Correspondence is making greater progress in the world,
and doing greater things in the political world, than the
electrical rod ever did in the physical; Ireland and England
have adopted it, but mean plagiaries as they are, they do
not acknowledge who was the inventor of it. Mr Lee and
Mr Izard will go with this letter in the Alliance, and probably
go to Boston. They will be able to inform you of
everything of a public nature much better than I can do,
as I have scarcely had opportunity to look about me as yet.
They will give you few hopes of peace, at least very
speedily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>The associations of counties and committees of correspondence
in England, are very ominous to our old acquaintances
the refugees, as they attack unmerited pensions
in the first place. But they must do greater things than
distressing these gentry; they must necessarily produce
great commotions in the nation. The speeches at these
meetings go great lengths, some of them openly justifying
and applauding the Americans, and others even applauding
France and Spain for stepping in to our assistance. The
Court here seems determined more than ever to pursue
the war with vigor, especially by sea, and above all in the
American seas. They have already sent seventeen ships
of the line under M. de Guichen, to reinforce M. de la
Motte Piquet, and seven others are preparing at Brest.
They are sending out clothing and arms for fifteen thousand
men for our army, and seem confident, that the next
campaign will be better than the last. I hope the spirit of
privateering among us will increase, because I think this
is the way in which we can do the most service to the
common cause. I hope you will be so good as to inform
me of what passes, particularly what progress the Convention
makes in the constitution.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> I assure you it is more
comfortable making constitutions in the dead of winter at

climbing on foot, or upon mules, over the mountains of
Galicia, and the Pyrenees.</p>

<h3>TO GENERAL JAMES WARREN.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">
Paris, February 23d, 1780.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Dear Sir,
</p>

<p>The French Court seems to be now every day more
and more convinced of the good policy, and indeed the
necessity of prosecuting the war with vigor in the American
seas. They have been, and are making great preparations
accordingly, and are determined to maintain a clear superiority.</p>

<p>M. de la Motte Piquet has with him the Hannibal, the
Magnifique, the Diad√®me, the Dauphin Royal, the Artisane,
the R√©fl√©chi, and the Vengeur, and if M. de Grace
has joined him from the Chesapeake Bay, the Robuste,
the Fendant, and the Sphinx; in all ten ships of the line.
M. de Guichen has gone to join him with the Couronne,
eighty guns, the Triumphant, eighty; the Palmier, the
Victoire, the Destin, the Conqu√©rant, the Citoyen, the Intr√©pide,
the Hercule, and the Souverain, all of seventyfour;
the Jason, the Actionnaire, the Caton, the Julien, the
Solitaire, the St Michael, and the Triton, all of sixtyfour;
the frigates, the Medea, Courageuse, Gentille, and the
Charmante, all of thirtytwo. He had above a hundred
sail of vessels under his convoy, and the regiment of Touraine
and Enghien, of more than thirteen hundred men
each, and the second battalions of Royal Corntois, and of
Walsh, of seven hundred men each, making in the whole
more than four thousand troops. Besides these, there are
seven more preparing at Brest to sail.</p>

<p>M. Gerard, Mr Jay, and Mr Carmichael are arrived at
Cadiz in a French frigate, the Confederacy having been
dismasted, and driven to Martinique. The Alliance carries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
this with Mr Lee and Mr Izard, who will no doubt be
treated with all respect at Boston.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the commotions in England and Ireland,
the success of Provost at Savannah, and of Rodney off
Gibraltar, and even the silly story of Omoa, in South
America, is enough to embolden the Ministry to go on with
a debt of two hundred millions, already contracted, to borrow
twelve or fourteen millions a year, in the beginning of
a war with France and Spain, each having a greater navy
than they ever had, each discovering a greater fighting
spirit than they ever did before, and obliging the English
to purchase every advantage at a dear rate. The premiums
and bounties, that they are obliged to give to raise
men, both for the service by sea and land, and the interest
of money they borrow, are greater than were ever given in
any former wars, even in the last year of the last war.
This cannot always last, nor indeed long. Yet I do not
expect to see peace very soon.</p>

<p>Pray write me as often as possible, and send the newspapers
to me.</p>

<h3>COUNT DE VERGENNES TO JOHN ADAMS.</h3>

<h4>Translation.</h4>

<p class="letter_head">
Versailles, February 24th, 1780.</p>

<p>Sir,
</p>

<p>I have received the letter, which you have done me the
honor to write me the 19th of this month. Your full powers,
of which you have been pleased to send me a copy, are
perfectly conformable to what M. Gerard has written to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
me about them, and they leave us nothing to wish for, as
to the form or matter. I think there will be no inconveniency
in informing the public of the principal object of
your mission, I mean the future pacification. It will be
announced in the Gazette of France, when it will mention
your presentation to the King and royal family, and
you will be at liberty to give your eventual character a
greater publicity, by having it published in the Dutch papers.
I could only wish, that you would be so kind as to
communicate the article to me before you transmit it.
With regard to the full powers, which authorise you to negotiate
a treaty of commerce with the Court of London, I
think it will be prudent not to communicate them to any
body whatever, and to take every necessary precaution,
that the British Ministry may not have a premature knowledge
of them. You will no doubt easily feel the motives,
which induce me to advise you to take this precaution, and
it would be needless to explain them.</p>

<p>With regard to your instructions, Sir, I am satisfied that
they have for their certain and invariable basis, the treaties
subsisting between the King and the United States. M.
Gerard has assured the King of it, in the most positive manner,
and his Majesty does more justice to the uprightness
of Congress, and to the stability of the sentiments which
they have hitherto manifested, than to have ever entertained,
or to entertain, the least doubt on this subject. This
way of thinking will convince you, Sir, that we have no
need of seeing your instructions, to appreciate properly the
principles and dispositions of Congress towards Great Britain.</p>

<p>
I have the honor to be, &amp;c.</p>

from his Excellency the Count de Vergennes, dated
the 24th of February, which I answered this day. Copies
of both letters are enclosed.</p>

Congress will see of what wonderful efficacy in pulling
down tyranny a committee of correspondence is likely to
be. Ireland has done great things by means of it, England
is attempting great things with it, after the example of the
Americans, who invented it, and first taught its use.
Yet all does not seem to produce the proper gratitude on
the minds of the English towards their benefactors. However,
the glory of the invention is as certainly ours, as that
of electrical rods, Hadley's quadrant, or inoculation for

<h3>TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">
Paris, February 27th, 1780.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,
</p>

<p>There are so many gentlemen of rank going out to
America, that there can be no doubt Congress will be
fully informed of the state of public affairs.</p>

<p>Mr Lee, Mr Izard, the Marquis de Lafayette, Mr
Wharton, and many others, are going by different vessels.
Besides these, Monsieur de l'Etombe, who is appointed
Consul General of France for the northern district of
America, as M. Holker for the middle, (I have not yet
learned who for the southern,) will go soon.</p>

<p>There is an armament preparing with the greatest expedition
at Brest, which is to be commanded by M. de
Ternay, and to consist of eight or ten ships of the line and
frigates, six of the line and several frigates, as it is said,
(perhaps it is not yet certain nor determined exactly how
many of either,) with several thousand men; all numbers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
are mentioned from six to ten thousand men, under the
General officers de Rochambeau and Jaucourt. Whether
this force is destined to the continent or the West Indies,
time will discover; at present, it ought not to be known.
On the other hand, I see by a paragraph in a London paper
of the 16th of this month, that the Thunderer, Torbay,
Ramilies, Royal Oak, Triumph, and Egmont, are ordered
for the West Indies, under Captain Walsingham; the
Southampton, St Albans, and Winchelsea, which were
talked of to go with him, are found unfit for service, and in
so bad a condition as to be ordered to be paid off. Thus
the French are likely to be drawn into the American
seas in sufficient force, where they have great advantages
in carrying on the war. It is much to be wished,
that the Spaniards could be drawn into the same field
of battle, for Gibraltar must be taken in America if ever.</p>

<p>There are some persons, however, who think that the
English will avenge the French, the Spaniards, and above
all the Americans, upon one another, and it is certain that
parties in England are working up to a crisis. The petitions
of the counties, their numerous committees of correspondence,
their hints of associations, have most certainly
alarmed the King and his Ministers to so great a degree, that
for some time their conduct was equivocal, giving hopes at
times to the people, that the Crown would favor the desired
reformation in the expenditure of money. But upon
the news of Rodney's successes they grew bolder, and
determined to exert all the authority of the Crown to suppress
the meetings of the people. Accordingly the cry of
faction, sedition, and rebellion, was set up in Parliament by
the majority, and the King was advised to dismiss those
lieutenants of counties, who had favored the meetings of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
the people, advice which he has certainly taken. This is
a decisive measure. It will either discourage and suppress
those meetings, petitions, correspondence, and associations
altogether, or it will give them greater force.</p>

<p>By a debate in the House of Commons on the 14th of
this month, one would think that the nation was nearly on
the brink of a civil war. Yet, I confess, I cannot think
that there are any characters at present in whom the
nation have sufficient confidence, to venture themselves
any lengths under their guidance, and I believe that this
spirited conduct of the King will defeat the measures of
the counties, unless, indeed, in the course of the next
campaign, his arms, especially by sea, should meet with
any signal defeat, which would perhaps reanimate the
people. But supposing the people go on and succeed so
far as to effect a change in the Ministry, the question is,
whether this would be an advantage to us or our allies?
I am myself very far from being convinced that it would.</p>

<p>There are none of the principal leaders of the people,
who avow any fixed principle, that we can depend upon.
None that avow a design of acknowledging our independence,
or even of making peace.</p>

<p>By letters, which I have received from Brussels and
Holland, since my arrival, I am told that the late desperate
step of the English in seizing the Dutch ships has made a
great change in the minds of the people there, and the
government too in our favor; even the Prince declares
he has been deceived by the English, and that he will
promote unlimited convoys; that an American Minister
is much wished for, who, although he might not yet be
publicly received, would be able to do as much good as
if he was; that money might be borrowed there by such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
a Minister directly sent by Congress, applying directly to
solid Dutch houses. I hope every hour to hear of Mr
Laurens' arrival.</p>

<p>I have subscribed for the English papers, but have not
yet received any, which I am sorry for, because I can
get none to enclose. As fast as they come to me I will
send them. I have the honor to enclose another <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mercure

<p class="letter_open">Sir,

<p>I have this moment received a letter from M. Genet,
who is one of the first Secretaries in the office of Foreign
Affairs, and who has the care of publishing all things relative
to America, and has already translated the constitutions
of New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia,
and South Carolina, requesting me to assist him in

Rhode Island, Massachusetts Bay, and New Hampshire.</p>

<p>There is so great a curiosity through all Europe to see
our new constitutions, and those already published in the
languages of Europe have done us so much honor, that
I thought I should be excusable in making a direct request

which M. Genet still desires.</p>

<p>Those of Rhode Island and Connecticut, being according

Massachusetts and New Hampshire, whenever they shall
be formed and established, will be easily obtained. But
those of North Carolina and Georgia, I could not obtain
when I was at Boston, and these are therefore the ones
which M. Genet wants at present, and which I have ventured

<h3>TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">
Paris, March 3d, 1780.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,
</p>

<p>The news of the day is, that Rodney has gone with his
whole fleet to the West Indies, that Du Chaffault is to command
the French fleet in America, and the Count d'Estaing
in the channel; that a large force is to go to America,
either to the Islands or to the Continent, both of ships
and troops in two divisions; that the last letters from Holland
breathe a spirit somewhat warlike, and indeed the
English have treated them with so much indignity and contempt
as well as injustice, that one would think it was not
always to be borne.</p>

<p>It is not agreeable to my principles, nor to my feelings,
to injure the character even of an enemy at war; but it is
often possible to draw important inferences from the true
known character of a commander of the forces of an enemy.
It is therefore my duty to mention, that Rodney is
reported to be a man of dissipation and prodigality, a great
spendthrift, and virulent against us; that he has often declared,
that if he had a command in America, his mode to
humiliate and subdue us should be, to burn every town and
every house, that he could come at upon the seacoast.</p>

<p>That such a plan of military execution will be sooner or
later adopted by the Court of London, I have not the least
doubt, from their known principles, tempers, characters,
and past conduct, provided it should ever be in their power
to attempt it in the whole or in part. And if this is the
disposition and system of their Admiral Rodney, the appointment
of him raises a presumption, that they have given
him express orders to this purpose at this time. An uncommon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
coincidence of favorable circumstances has thrown
the whole Caracas fleet into his hands, and given a victory,
although pretty dearly paid for, over a much inferior
fleet of Spanish men of war. If he is therefore a man of
such levity as is represented, and so malicious against us,
and has such malignant orders from his Court, and goes
to America flushed and giddy with success, we may expect
he will do mischief if he can, and we ought to be upon our
guard.</p>

<p>My business is peace, but I think of nothing but war.
While our enemies think of nothing else, we ought not to
think more of peace than to be ready to treat of it, as soon
as it shall be put into the hearts of our foes to be willing
for it. Americans must be soldiers, they must war by sea
and land, they have no other security.</p>

to be with much respect, &amp;c.</p>

<h3>TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">
Paris, March 4th, 1780.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,
</p>

<p>I have the honor to enclose the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mercure de France</i> of
this day, which contains among other interesting intelligence
Admiral Rodney's narration, after his good fortune
on the 8th of January last in meeting the Spanish Caracas
fleet, which sailed from St Sebastian the 1st of January,
under convoy of seven armed vessels belonging to the Caracas
company. The Guipuscoa, of sixtyfour guns, and
five hundred and fifty men; the San Carlos, of thirtytwo
guns, and two hundred men; the San Raphael, of thirty
guns, and one hundred and fiftyfive men; the Santa Theresa,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
of twentyeight guns, and one hundred and fifty men;
the Corbetta San Firmin, of sixteen guns, and sixty men;
these armed vessels were all taken, and the Guipuscoa was
christened Prince William, in honor of his royal highness,
in whose presence she was taken and given to one of the
English captains, as a better ship than his former one, the
Bienfaisant.</p>

<p>The merchant vessels under this convoy are the Nostra
Senora de l'Ores, the San Francisco, the Conception, the
San Nicholas, the Jeronimo, the Divina Providentia, the
San Gibilan, the San Pactora, the San Lauren, the Bellona,
and the Esperanza, all loaded with flour and corn.
The Cervidada de Merica, loaded with provisions for the
navy, the Amisted, the San Michael, loaded with anchors
and cables, and the Bilboa, loaded with tobacco. Those
with provisions for the navy, and that with tobacco, were
sent to England under convoy of the America and the
Pearl, and those with corn and flour were carried into
Gibraltar.</p>

<p>This fleet seems to have been met at sea by the Admiral
by perfect accident, of which the English do not appear
to have had the least hope, nor the Spaniards the smallest
fear. It must therefore be allowed to be one instance of
the good fortune of the English Ministry and their Admiral,
or rather as it is reported, of the King and his Admiral.</p>

<p>Their good fortune, however, did not end here, for eight
days afterwards, on the 16th of January, they fell in with
Don Juan de Langura, with eleven vessels of the line, who
being so much inferior, could not hope for a victory. He
fought the English, however, upon the retreat with so much
bravery, skill, and success, that they were able to take
only three of his ships. The Ph&oelig;nix, of eighty guns, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
the Princessa, and Diligent, of seventyfour, were taken, and
the San Domingo blown up. The S. Genero, the S. Justo,
and the Monarcha, having separated before the battle, and
the S. Juliano, the S. Eugenio, the S. Augustine, and S.
Lorenzo, having since arrived in Cadiz, although in a bad
condition.</p>

<p>Thus the English have been permitted, against probabilities
and appearances, to throw succor into Gibraltar,
and perhaps Mahon, to give a little fresh confidence to the
Ministry, and make a few bonfires for the populace, but
have added very little to their riches or their power. In
the meantime, Rodney must have been retarded by these
lucky accidents, in his course to the West Indies, and given
opportunity to the Count de Guichen to arrive before him
in the West Indies, and prevent the reconquest of the Grenadas,
and perhaps do more, but of this Congress will be
informed sooner than I.</p>

<p>These successes have not suppressed the independent
spirit of Ireland, which is going on in a regular train, deliberating
upon bills for the independence of the judges, the
habeas corpus, the restriction, of subsidies, and discipline of
their troops, and they seem determined to throw off all the
authority of the British Parliament; nor that of the Committees
of Correspondence and petitioners in the counties of
England, which threaten associations, and, as the Ministry
themselves say, sedition, faction, tumults, and rebellion;
nor provided a fleet for the British channel for the ensuing
summer, nor assuaged the serious resentment of Holland,
for the piracies committed in violation of the faith of treaties,
as well as the laws of nature and nations, upon their
commerce. As it is most interesting to us to know the
forces to be employed in America, by which word I comprehend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
the West India Islands, as well as the coasts of the
Continent, all these being connected together in such a
manner as to make but one whole, I beg leave to lay before
Congress in one view, the French force that is intended
to be in that service.</p>

<p>There are actually at Cape Fran√ßois, the Touant of
eightyfour guns, the Robuste, and the Fendant, of seventyfour,
the Sphinx of sixtyfour, and the Amphion of fifty, in
all five. At Martinique, the Admirable, the Magnifique,
the Dauphin Royal, and the Diad√®me, of seventyfour;
the R√©fl√©chi, the Vengeur, the Artisane, of sixtyfour, and
the Fiers of fifty. In all eight, making in the whole thirteen
ships of the line, reckoning as such two fiftys. If
the Count de Guichen should happily arrive, he has seventeen,
which will amount to the number of thirty, besides
frigates. Six others are preparing at Brest with all possible
expedition, under the command of M. de Ternay.
The Duc de Burgone of eighty guns, the Neptune of seventyfour,
M. Destouches; the Magnanime of seventyfour,
M. de Vaudreuil; the Eveille of sixtyfour, M. de Trobuiand;
the Jason of sixtyfour, M. de Marigny. With this
fleet the troops are to be embarked, and there are many
conjectures, that it is intended for North America. The
Languedoc, the C√¶sar, the Provence, and the Fantasque,
of the fleet of the Count d'Estaing, are careened and refitted,
and the Royal Louis of one hundred and ten guns,
the Northumberland, and the Astrea are to be launched
immediately.</p>

<p>In the course of my peregrinations, at Brest, L'Orient,
and Ferrol, I have had an opportunity to see most of these
ships, and to be on board many of them, and one would
think there was force enough to protect us, and quiet our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
fears, but the battle is not always to the strong, and we
must wait patiently for time to decide events.</p>

<p>
I have the honor to be, &amp;c.</p>

<h3>TO SAMUEL ADAMS.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">
Paris, March 4th, 1780.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Dear Sir,
</p>

<p>This will be delivered to you by Mr Izard, who goes
out in the Alliance with Mr Lee, Mr Wharton, Mr Brown,
and others. He will wait on you of course, and will be
able to give you good information concerning the intentions
of the English, and their military preparations by sea and
land, and those of the French and Spaniards, at the same
time. He will also give his opinion very freely concerning
American and other characters here, as well as measures.</p>

<p>In many things his opinions may be just, but in some
and those not a few, I am sure they are wrong. The
great principle, in which I have differed from him, is this,
in the mode of treating with this Court. He has been
always of opinion, that it was good policy and necessary to
hold a high language to this Court; to represent to them
the danger of our being subdued, if they did not do this
and the other thing for us, in order to obtain money and
other aids from them. He is confident they would not
have dared to refuse anything.</p>

<p>Although no man in America, or in the world, was earlier
convinced than I was, that it was the interest of France
and Spain to support the independence of America, and
that they would support it, and that no man is more sensible
than I am of the necessity they are under to support<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
us, yet I am not, nor ever was, of opinion, that we could
with truth or with good policy assume the style of menace,
and threaten them with returning again to Great Britain,
and joining against France and Spain, even telling them
that we should be subdued, because I never believed this
myself, and the Court here would not have believed it
from us. The Court have many difficulties to manage, as
well as we, and it is delicate and hazardous to push things
in this country. Things are not to be negotiated here as
they are with the people of America, even with the tories
in America, or as with the people of England. There is
a frankness, however, that ought to be used with the Ministry,
and a candor with which the truth may be and has
been communicated, but there is a harshness, that would
not fail to ruin, in my opinion, the fairest negotiation in this
country.</p>

<p>We are anxious to hear from you, having nothing since
the beginning of December, and very little since we left
you.</p>

<p>Enclosed are the <cite>Courrier de l'Europe</cite>, of the 3d, and
the <cite>Gazette de France</cite> of this day. The House of Lords
and the House of Commons are voting thanks to Admiral
Rodney for his good fortune, for they all seem to confess,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
that his brilliant successes were not owing to more skill,
valor, or vigilance than others have shown, but merely to
his good luck, which, by a report that spreads and gains
credit today, did not end with his advantage over Langara,
and his safe departure from Gibraltar. It is said that two
French ships of the line and several frigates with transports,
bound to the Isle of France, in the East Indies, have
been doomed to fall in his way, and be taken.</p>

<p>Whether this is true or not, he has done enough it
seems to be in a fair way of paying his creditors some part
of their demands for money, which he has gambled away,
and which they had despaired of ever receiving. This
run of good luck, however, could never have happened to
the gambler, if the game had been played otherwise by
the opposite party; if France and Spain, instead of keeping
immense fleets in Europe with nothing to do, or employed
in blocking up Gibraltar, which is a trifle, if taken
in comparison of other objects in view, had but employed
but a fourth part of them in the American seas, where
they had, and still have, the enemies in their power, Rodney's
creditors had still been in despair, together with the
British government and nation.</p>

<p>I would not desire a better proof, that the English are in
the power of their enemies in the American world, than
the list of the prizes printed in the <cite>Courrier de l'Europe</cite>,

middle district of Massachusetts Bay. I am very glad to
see this method taken of publishing to the world the success
of our privateers, because it will in time show our

enemies.</p>

<h3>TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">
Paris, March 12th, 1780.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,
</p>

<p>It is an observation made some years ago by a great
writer of this nation, de Mably, that the project of being
sole master of the sea, and of commanding all the commerce,
is not less chimerical nor less ruinous, than that of
universal monarchy on land, and it is to be wished, for the
happiness of Europe, that the English may be convinced
of this truth, before they shall learn it by their own experience.
France has already repeated several times,
that it was necessary to establish an equilibrium, a balance
of power at sea, and she has not yet convinced anybody,
because she is the dominant power, and because they suspect
her to desire the abasement of the English, only that
she may domineer the more surely on the Continent. But
if England abuses her power, and would exercise a kind of
tyranny over commerce, presently all the States that have
vessels and sailors, astonished that they had not before believed
France, will join themselves to her in avenging her
injuries.</p>

<p>The present conjuncture of affairs resembles so exactly
the case here put, that it seems to be a literal fulfilment of
a prophecy.</p>

<p>A domination upon the sea is so much the more dangerous
to other maritime powers and commercial nations, as it
is more difficult to form alliances and combine forces at sea
than at land. For which reason it is essential, that the sovereign
of every commercial State should make his nation's
flag respected in all the seas, and by all the nations of the
world. The English have ever acted upon this principle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
in supporting the honor of their own flag, but of late
years have grown less and less attentive to it, as it respects
the honor of other flags. Not content with making their
flag respectable, they have grown more and more ambitious
of making it terrible. Unwilling to do as they
would be done by, and to treat other commercial nations
as they have insisted upon being treated by them, they
have grown continually more and more haughty, turbulent,
and insolent upon the seas, and are now never satisfied
until they have made all other nations see, that
they despise them upon that element. It is said by the
Baron de Bielfield, that piracies and robberies at sea are
so odious, so atrocious, and so destructive to the interest
of all the European nations, that everything is permitted
to repress them. Providence has not granted to any people
an exclusive empire upon the seas. To aim at setting
up a master there, to prescribe laws to other free nations,
is an outrage to all Europe.</p>

<p>I have quoted these authorities, because they contain
the true principle, upon which as I have ever conceived,
the English began this war, and upon which they will
assuredly continue it, as long as they can get men and
money, which will be as long as they have success. They
contain also the true principles of France, Spain, and Holland,
and all the powers of Europe. The outrages committed
upon the Dutch commerce, and the insults offered
to their flag, ought to be, and are, alarming to all the maritime
powers. The late successes of the English will
have no tendency to allay the fears of these powers; on
the contrary they will increase the alarm, by showing the
precarious situation they will all be in if England should
finally succeed, which some of them may perhaps apprehend
from the late brilliant fortune of Admiral Rodney.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>One cannot but be struck with the rapid series of fortunate
incidents for the English, which have been published
here in about the course of three months, that I have been
in Europe. The little affair of Omoa began it, the repulse
at Savannah succeeded, with all its consequences, the
Curra√ßoa fleet was next, Langara's fleet soon followed;
Gibraltar was relieved; Don Gaston's squadron was dispersed
by a storm; and Admiral Rodney had opportunity
to get safe out of Gibraltar. The French East India fleet
brings up the rear. There is hardly in history such a
series of events, that no human wisdom could provide
against or foresee. Yet after all, the advantages gained
are by no means decisive, although no doubt it will raise
the ambition of the English, and in some degree damp the
ardor of their enemies.</p>

<p>It must not have this effect however upon America.
Let the maritime powers fare as they will, we must be free,
and I trust in God we shall be so, whatever be their fate.
The events of war are uncertain at sea, more than even
by land; but America has resources for the final defence
of her liberty, which Britain will never be able to exhaust,
though she should exhaust France and Spain, and it may
not impossibly be our hard fate, but it will be our unfading
glory finally to turn the scale of the war, to humble
the pride, which is so terrible to the commercial nations of
Europe, and to produce a balance of power on the seas.
To this end Americans must be soldiers and seamen.</p>

<p>It is proper, however, to keep constantly in sight, the
power against which we have to contend; the English have
in all the ports of England, in a condition for actual service,
or at least given out and reported to be so, twenty ships
of the line. In the course of the spring and the month of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
June, eight others which are now repairing, and three new
ones in the course of the year. The whole squadron for
the Channel will be thirtyone. The squadron of Arbuthnot,
at New York, consists of five. That of Jarvis at the
Western Islands is two, including the Dublin, which was
detached from Admiral Rodney, and is now in bad condition
at Lisbon. One only at Jamaica, for the Lion is
too far ruined to be counted. The fleet at the other
islands, joined by the Hector, detached from Rodney, the
Triumph and the Intrepid, lately sailed from England, are
nineteen, seven of which at least are in too bad a condition
for actual service. That of India, including two which
serve for convoys, consists of ten, two of which however
are returning to be repaired or condemned; the Lenox is
a guard ship in Ireland.</p>

<p>Rodney entered Gibraltar with four Spanish ships of the
line, the Ph&oelig;nix of eighty guns, the Monarca, the Princessa,
and the Diligente of seventy, besides the Guipuscoa,
now the Prince William, of sixtyfive, which he took with
the convoy on the 8th of January. He entered, also, with
the Shrewsbury of seventyfour, which joined him from
Lisbon. His squadron must therefore have consisted of
twentyfour ships of the line. If he left the Panther and
another at Gibraltar, he must have gone out with twentytwo.</p>

<p>Whether he has gone with the whole fleet to the West
Indies, or whether with part of it, and what part, is yet
undetermined by the public.</p>

<p>France and Spain, however, have a vast superiority still
remaining, which, if it should be ably managed, will easily
humble the English; but if it should be unwisely managed,
or continue to be as unfortunate as it has been from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>
moment of the Count d'Estaing's sailing from Toulon, it
will even in this case last long enough to consume and
exhaust their enemies.</p>

<p>I have the honor to enclose the <cite>Mercure de France</cite>,
of the 11th of March, the Hague Gazette of the 6th,
and 8th, the Amsterdam Gazette of the 7th, and the
Leyden of the 7th.</p>

<h3>TO EDMUND JENNINGS.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></h3>

<p class="letter_head">
Paris, March 12th, 1780.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Dear Sir,
</p>

<p>I have to acknowledge the receipt of three excellent
letters, one of the 1st, the others of the 5th and 8th of
March. I thank you for the copy of your letter to the
pensioner, and for your dialogue between York and Chatham.</p>

<p>It is undoubtedly the duty of every commercial nation,
to make their flag respected in all the seas, and by all the
nations, not by insulting and injuring all others, like Great
Britain, but by doing justice to all others, and by insisting
upon justice from them. But how is Holland to obtain
justice from the English, who take a manifest pleasure and
pride in showing her and all Europe, that they despise
her? Holland seems to be as corrupted and unprincipled
as Great Britain, but there is one great difference between
them. Great Britain has a terrible naval force, Holland
has next to none. Great Britain has courage and confidence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>
in her power, Holland has none. I do not mean that
the Dutch are destitute of personal courage, but national
courage is a very different thing.</p>

<p>The curious doctrine of a constitutional impossibility of
acknowledging our independence is well exposed in your
dialogue. I suppose the idea was taken from Lord Chatham's
dying speech, when he conjured up the ghost of the
Princess Sophia of Hanover, to whose posterity, being Protestants,
the act of settlement had consecrated the succession
of the crown and its authority over all parts of the
dominions. This was a masterly stroke of oratory, to be
sure, and shows, that my Lord Chatham in his last moments
had not lost the knowledge of the prejudices in the
character of the English nation, nor the arts of popularity.
But a more manifest address to the passions and prejudices
of the populace, without the least attention to the justice
or policy of the principle, never fell from a popular orator,
ancient or modern. Could my Lord Chatham contend,
that the heirs of the Princess Sophia of Hanover, provided
they should be Protestants, had the throne and its prerogatives
entailed upon them, to everlasting ages, over all parts
of the British dominions, let them do what they would?
Govern without Parliament, by laws without law, dismiss
judges without fault, suspend laws, in short do everything
that the Stewarts did, and ten times more, yet so long as
they were Protestants, could there be no resistance to their
will, and no forfeiture of their right to govern? I said this
was a figure of rhetoric, employed by his Lordship <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad captandum
vulgus</i>. I believe so still, but I believe he meant it
also <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad captandum regem</i>, and that he thought, by throwing
out this idea, that he was not for acknowledging our independence,
the King, who at that time was distressed for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
Minister able in conducting a war, would call him into the
Ministry. I ever lamented this black spot in a very bright
character. I do not remember anything in his Lordship's
conduct, which seemed to me so suspicious to have proceeded
from a perverted heart as this flight. Allowance,
however, ought to be made; perhaps he was misunderstood,
and would have explained himself fairly if he had lived.</p>

<p>I have not seen the pamphlet entitled <cite>Facts</cite>, nor that by
Lloyd, nor the <cite>Examen</cite>. I should be glad to see all of
them. I find a difficulty in getting pamphlets from England,
but I shall have a channel to obtain them by and by.
I went to Mr Grant's as soon as I received yours of the
8th. Mr Grant the father was out, and no other in the
house knew anything of your letter, or maps, or other
things. I will speak to the father the first opportunity.
Mr Lee is gone to L'Orient.</p>

<p>What think you of luck? Had any gambler ever so
much as Rodney. One of our tories in Boston, or half
way whigs, told me once, God loves that little island of Old
England, and the people that live upon it. I suppose he
would say now, God loves Rodney. I do not draw the
same conclusion from the successes, that the island or the
hero have had. Who can be persuaded to believe,
that he loves so degenerate and profligate a race? I
think it more probable, that heaven has permitted this
series of good fortune to attend the wicked, that the
righteous Americans may reflect in time, and place their
confidence in their own patience, fortitude, perseverance,
political wisdom, and military talents, under the protection
and blessing of his providence.</p>

<p>There are those who believe, that if France and Spain had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
not interposed, America would have been crushed. There
are in other parts of Europe, I am told, a greater number
who believe, that if it had not been for the interposition of
France and Spain, American independence would have
been acknowledged by Great Britain a year or two ago.
I believe neither the one nor the other. I know the deep
roots of American independence on one side of the water,
and I know the deep roots of the aversion to it on the
other. If it was rational to suppose, that the English
should succeed in their design, and endeavor to destroy the
fleets and naval power of France and Spain, which they
are determined to do if they can, what would be the consequence?
There are long lists of French and Spanish
ships of the line yet to be destroyed, which would cost
the English several campaigns and a long roll of millions,
and after this they may send sixty thousand men to America,
if they can get them, and what then? Why, the glory
of baffling, exhausting, beating, and taking them, will finally
be that of the American yeomanry, whose numbers
have increased every year since this war began, as I learnt
with certainty in my late visit home, and will increase every
year, in spite of all the art, malice, skill, valor, and activity
of the English and all their allies. I hope, however, that
the capricious goddess will bestow some of her favors upon
France and Spain, and a very few of them would do the
work. If Rodney's fortune should convince Spain, that
she is attacking the bull by the horns, and France and
Spain, that the true system for conducting this war, is by
keeping just force enough in the Channel to protect their
coasts and their trade, and by sending all the rest of their
ships into the American seas, it will be the best fortune for
the allies they ever had.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>I long to learn Mr Jay's success at Madrid, and Mr
Laurens' arrival in Holland, where I will go to see him
some time in the summer or autumn.</p>

<h3>TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">
Paris, March 14th, 1780.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,
</p>

<p>By a letter from London of the 3d of this month, received
since my former of this day's date, I learn that the
friends of the Ministry were in hopes every hour to hear
that Clinton, who embarked seven thousand effective men,
(though they are said to be ten) in the latter end of December,
is in possession of Charleston. The detachment consisted
of the light infantry and grenadiers of the seventh,
twentythird, thirtythird, fortysecond, sixtythird, and sixtyfourth
British regiments, a legion of horse, yagers, four battalions
of Hessian grenadiers; the New York volunteers,
Ferguson's corps; one Hessian regiment, and a detachment
of the seventyfirst British regiment. Many are of opinion
that a part of this army was intended for the Windward
Islands, and that they embarked and sailed the 26th of
December, and was much hurt by a storm after sailing.
Two thousand, under Lord Cornwallis, were said to be
intended for the Chesapeake, to burn two or three men
of war in James river, and to serve as a division to the
other five, going against Charleston.</p>

<p>The friends of the Administration are not in spirits about
the picture of affairs in America and the West Indies.
They fear the French will have a superiority there, from
whence some late accounts are arrived of vast sickness and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
disorder on board the English ships. The naval war will,
to appearance, be removed for the next summer to that
quarter. Rodney was to sail with four ships only to the
West Indies; and Walsingham will not take more than that
number as a convoy to about one hundred West Indiamen,
which were to sail about the 20th of this month, and more
ships of war would probably conduct this fleet off the land,
and it was probable in the New York and Quebec trade
about fifty vessels more would sail about the same time.
That there was no talk of any troops or ships going to New
York or Quebec. That there was a rumor that Wallace
would have a small squadron, and carry four or five thousand
men out, but this was not believed. That the Ministry
had been hard pressed in several parliamentary questions
lately; that their party was losing ground daily; that the
county petitions for reformation were a heavy weight upon
them; that it was likely there would be serious disturbances,
if reforms do not take place; that the committees
for each county have already appointed three deputies to
meet and act for the whole, which is the beginning of a
Congress, and will probably be soon called by that name;
that it was hard to determine whether these movements at
home, or the proceedings in Ireland, chagrin the Ministry
most; that the sovereignty of England over Ireland will
not be of many month's duration; that the armed associations
in the latter amount to sixtyfour thousand men, who
seem determined to free themselves from every restriction
that has been laid on them; that their Parliament is about
putting an end to all appeals to England; to render the
judges independent of the crown, they at present holding
their offices <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">durante bene placito</i>, and not <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">quamdiu se
bene gesserunt</i>, as in England; to have a habeas corpus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span>
act; to repeal Poyning's law, which enacts that all bills
shall originate in the council and not in the commons; to
confine the new supplies to the appointment of new duties
only; to give bounties on their own manufactures, and to
have a mutiny bill, which last goes immediately to the
grand point of jurisdiction.</p>

<p>That, however, notwithstanding all the present appearances
against Great Britain, and the certainty of America's
succeeding to her wish, there are not among even those, who
are called patriots in Parliament, many who possess directly
a wish for American independence; that Lords Camden,
Effingham, Coventry, and the Bishop of St Asaph are
clearly and distinctly for it; Sir G. Saville, and but a few
others in the House of Commons; that the rest of the
patriots are for sovereignty; America to give up the French
alliance, make up a federal alliance with England, by
which no doubt they mean an alliance offensive and defensive,
&amp;c.</p>

<p>It is surely unnecessary for me to make any observations
upon the absurdity of these provisos, so injurious to the
honor of our country, and so destructive of her most essential
rights and interests. By a letter of the 7th, a vessel
with two hundred Hessians or Yagers on board has arrived
at St Ives, in Cornwall. She sailed with the expedition
from New York, the 26th of December, and a few days
after received much damage in a storm, which it is thought
separated and dispersed the fleet. This gives us great
spirits and sanguine hopes for Charleston. I have the
honor to enclose several newspapers, and, with much respect,
to be, &amp;c.</p>

<h3>TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">
Paris, March, 14th, 1780.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,
</p>

<p>I have taken some pains to inform myself what number
of regular troops the enemy have in the three kingdoms,
because we may form some judgment from this, whether
they will be able to send any, and what reinforcements to
North America or the West Indies. I am assured, that
they have not more than four thousand regular troops in
Ireland, and these chiefly horse. It is not to be expected
then, I think, that they can spare any of these. There is
too much danger even of popular commotions in England,
Scotland, and Ireland, to spare many of these, if they were
perfectly safe, or thought themselves so from French and
Spanish invasions. I have, however, written to obtain
more exact and authentic information, which I will not fail
to transmit as early as possible.</p>

<p>I have received an account at length, both by the Gazette
Extraordinary, and by letter from London, that Admiral
Digby is returned with the fleet and Spanish prizes
from Gibraltar, and brought in with him the Prot√©e, a
French sixtyfour gun ship, and three small store ships, part
of a fleet bound from L'Orient to the East Indies. The
sixtyfour gun ship had about sixtythree thousand pounds in
cash on board. This fleet was unlucky enough to fall in
with Digby on the 23d of February. Rodney sailed from
Gibraltar on the 14th, and parted with Digby on the 18th,
taking only four ships of the line with him to the West Indies.
A like number will probably go under Walsingham
about the 20th or 25th of this month, with the fleet to the
West Indies. It is said in letters from London, that by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>
every appearance, there are no more troops going to North
America, and that it looks as if the Ministry mean not to
continue the American war, but to let it dwindle and die
away. If this should be the case, it is to be hoped that the
Americans and their allies will not let it dwindle, but put it
to death at a blow.</p>

<p>The Marquis de Lafayette, and his brother the Viscount
de Noailles, a young noble officer, who is worthy of his
family, and of the relation he bears to the Marquis, who I
hope will be the bearer of this letter, will be able to say
more upon this head. At present the King and his General
are the only persons, who ought to know the secret.</p>

I have the honor to be, &amp;c.</p>

<h3>TO JAMES LOVELL.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">
Paris, March 16th, 1780.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Dear Sir,
</p>

<p>I have received, since my arrival here, your favor of the
16th of November, 1779. I shall take proper notice of
your remarks upon the 13th and 19th articles of the treaty.
They are both of them of importance, and, as to the last,
I wish for an instruction upon it, because there is no
doubt to be made, that whenever a serious negotiation
shall be commenced, great pains will be taken for the banished,
although little attention is paid to them now. I
learned yesterday, that they have received no payment of
their pensions these eighteen months. The delay is colored
with a pretence of waiting for some funds for Quebec,
which have been stopped by the interruption of that trade.
They are still bitter, as I am told, and are firmly persuaded,
that America cannot hold out six months longer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span>You assure me, that I shall not be without the orders and
credit, which I mentioned in a letter of mine. I thank you
for this assurance, which is conceived in such strong terms,
that one would think you did not expect any opposition to
it; at least, an effectual opposition. I wish there may not
be, but I am not without conjectures, I will not call them
suspicions, upon this head. Denying them, however,
would be virtually recalling me and Mr Dana, and in a
manner the most humiliating and disgraceful. Indeed, I
do not know how we should get away from our creditors.
You know what sort of minds cannot bear a brother near
the throne; and so fair, so just, so economical a method,
would not escape minds of so much penetration, as a refusal
to lend money without orders. I am not sure, however,
that the measure would be hazarded in the present
circumstances, by persons by whom I have been treated
politely enough since my return.</p>

<p>I should be glad to know what the Board of Treasury
have done with my accounts; whether they have passed
upon them; or whether there are any objections to them,
and what they are. I do not know but I was indiscreet in
sending all my original vouchers, because, if any of them
should be lost, I might be puzzled to explain some things.
However, I know by a letter from Mr Gerry, that they
were received, and I presume they will be preserved.</p>

<p>I wish to know your private opinion, whether Congress
will continue Mr Dana and me here, at so much expense,
with so little prospect of having anything to do for a long
time; an uncertain time, however; or, whether they will
revoke our powers, and recall us; or what they will do
with us. A situation so idle and inactive is not agreeable
to my genius; yet I can submit to it as well as any man,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span>
if it be thought necessary for the public good. I will do
all the service I can, by transmitting intelligence, and in
every other way.</p>

<p>You must have observed, that in all my public letters,
and, indeed, in a great measure in my private ones, I have
cautiously avoided giving accounts of the state of our
affairs in France. I had many reasons for this caution.
In general, I was sure it would do no good, and I doubted
the propriety of stating facts, and remarking upon characters,
without giving notice of it to the persons concerned,
and transmitting the evidence. There is no end of conceiving
jealousies; but, I am sure, that officers of government,
especially foreign Ministers, ought not to attack and
accuse one another upon jealousies, nor without full proof;
nor then, without notifying the party to answer for himself.</p>

<p>Thus much let me say, however, that the present plan
of having a distinct Minister in Spain, another in Holland,
and another to treat with Great Britain, and having Secretaries
independent of Ministers, is a good one. I pray
you to stand by it with the utmost firmness, if it should be
attacked or undermined. If you revoke the powers of a
separate Minister to treat with the King of Great Britain,
you ought to revoke the former powers of treating with all
the Courts of Europe, which were given to the Commissioners
at Passy; for, under these, authority will be
claimed of treating with the English, if my powers are
revoked. The powers of treating with all other Courts
ought to be separated from the mission.</p>

Your friend, &amp;c.</p>

<h3>TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">
Paris, March 18th, 1780.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,
</p>

<p>We have this moment the news of the arrival of the
convoy from St Domingo, with sixty sail of merchant
vessels, which is a great event for this country.</p>

<p>It is also reported, that ten sail of Spanish ships of the
line, with ten battalions of land forces have sailed, and their
destination is supposed to be North America.</p>

<p>The armament preparing at Brest, is thus described in
one of the public papers. The Count du Chaffault de
Besn√©, Lieutenant General of the naval forces in France,
has taken leave of the King, being presented to his Majesty
by M. de Sartine. The report runs, that orders
have been sent on the 29th of February, for the officers
who are at Paris to join their regiments upon the coasts
by the 15th of March, and that eight regiments are to embark
under the Count de Rochambeau. These regiments
are that of <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Anhalt</i>, whereof the Marquis de Bergen is
Colonel in second; <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Auvergne</i>, Colonel Commandant, the
Viscount de Lavel; <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bourbonnois</i>, Colonel Commandant,
the Marquis de Laval, and in second, the Viscount de Rochambeau;
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Neustrie</i>, Colonel Commandant, the Count de
Guibert, and in second, the Viscount le Veneur; <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Romergne</i>,
Colonel Commandant, the Viscount de Custine,
and in second, the Marquis du Ludec; <em>Royal Corse</em>,
Colonel Commandant, the Marquis du Luc, and in second,
the Count of Pontevez; <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Royal Deux Ponts</i>, Colonel
Commandant, the Count aux Ponts; <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Saintong√©</i>, Colonel
Commandant, the Viscount de Beranger, and in second,
the Marquis de Themines. It is asserted, that there will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>
be added a detachment of artillery, and that the Baron de
Viomenil, the Count de Chastellux, and the Count de
Witgenstein will embark with these troops, and that the
Duc de Lazun will have the command of a body of
twelve hundred volunteers, and be joined to the armament
under the Count de Rochambeau. All these troops, as it
is believed, will embark at Brest, and go out under the
convoy of the Count du Chaffault de Besn√©.</p>

<p>They add, that he will have more than thirtyseven ships
of the line under his command, destined for an expedition,
whereof the genuine object is yet unknown. Many other
regiments have also orders to march down nearer to those
upon the seacoast, and there are many vessels taken upon
freight for the service of the King, in the different ports of
the kingdom. The freight at Havre is thirty livres a ton,
on condition that the owner furnish his vessel for twelve
months. They say the Prince de Cond√© will go and
command upon the coast of Brittany with the Count de
Vaux.</p>

<p>By a letter I just now received from Holland, I am told
that the grand business is done between the northern
powers on a footing very convenient for Holland, as it
must compel the English to cease interrupting the trade of
the neutral powers. This would be more beneficial to
France and Spain than to Holland, by facilitating the acquisition
of ship timber, hemp, and all other things for the
supply of their arsenals of the marine. A principal branch
of the British policy has ever been, to prevent the growth
of the navies of their enemies, by intercepting their supplies.</p>

<p>What gives further countenance to this letter, and the
reports to the same purpose, which have been sometime
circulated, is an article in the <cite>Mercure de France</cite>, enclosed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span>
They talk of an alliance between Sweden, Denmark,
Russia, Prussia, and the United Province, for maintaining
the honor of the flags of these powers. Congress
will see also another paragraph from London, which favors
this idea. That the Baron de Nolker, Envoy Extraordinary
from Sweden, had declared that if the convoy of his
nation was not released forthwith, with an indemnification
for expenses and losses, he had orders to quit the Court of
London in twenty four hours.</p>

<p>Some other paragraphs seem to show the Dutch in
earnest about equipping a respectable naval force of fiftytwo
vessels.</p>

<h3>TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">
Paris, March 19th, 1780.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,
</p>

<p>Enclosed is a paper of the 10th of March, which was
accidentally omitted to be enclosed in the season of it.</p>

<p>There are two articles of intelligence, which ought not
to escape our observation, because they have relation to
the armament equipping at Brest, although I do not suppose
them of much consequence. The first is of a small
squadron of frigates, which is said to have sailed from
Portsmouth on the 28th of February, in consequence of
orders sent from the Admiralty on the 22d, under the command
of Captain Marshall, who is on board the Emerald,
of thirtytwo guns. The others are the Hussar of thirtytwo,
the Surprise of twentyeight, the Squirrel, and Heart
of Oak of twenty; the sloops, the Beaver's prize of fourteen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span>
the Wolf, and the Wasp of eight, with the cutters,
the Nimble and the Griffin. It is thought, that this little
squadron is gone to make a cruise on the coast of France,
to hinder the transports assembled in different ports from
going out, or even to destroy them, if that shall be found to
be possible. There is not, however, much to be dreaded
from this squadron so near the neighborhood of Brest.</p>

<p>The other paragraph discovers the marks of more ingenuity
and less truth. It is taken from the English papers,
that Captain Jarvis, in the Foudroyant of eighty guns,
who has been out upon a cruise, with a small division in
the mouth of the Channel, has returned to Plymouth and
gone to Court, to be himself the bearer to Government of
despatches of great importance, from the Court of France
to Congress, found on board a sloop, which on her passage
to Philadelphia fell into his hands. It is asserted, that
these despatches contain an ample detail of the operations
concerted between the Court of Versailles and Dr Franklin,
among which the most probable is, the project of attacking
Halifax, which is to be made by a body of troops
from New England, and by a detachment of French troops
very considerable by sea and land.</p>

<p>This moment a letter from London of the 10th of
March informs me, that a packet boat is arrived from Jamaica,
which sailed the 29th of January, with accounts,
that Fort Omoa is again in possession of Spain. That an
English man-of-war has taken a Spanish ship-of-war, bound
to South America with stores. She was pierced for sixtyfour,
but earned only fiftytwo guns. The Jamaica fleet
sailed on the 24th of January, convoyed slightly, with
two fiftys and two frigates, about forty merchantmen in
all. Nothing yet from America, but it is generally believed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>
that a storm has separated and dispersed Clinton's
fleet, intended for the Southern expedition.</p>

<h3>TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">
Paris, March 20th, 1780</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,
</p>

<p>I have at length received a parcel of English papers,
which I have the honor to enclose with this to Congress.
They are the General Advertiser, and the Morning Post,
both of which I shall for the future be able to transmit
regularly every week. Congress will see that these papers
are of opposite parties, one being manifestly devoted to
the Court and the Ministry, and the majority, the other to
the opposition, the committees, the associations, and petitions;
between both I hope Congress will be informed of
the true facts.</p>

<p>There is the appearance of a piquancy and keenness in
the temper of the opposite parties, by their writings and
paragraphs in these papers, that looks like the commencement
of a serious quarrel.</p>

<p>By the violence of the manner in which such characters
as Keppel, Howe, Burgoyne, Richmond, Shelburne,
Rockingham, &amp;c. are treated, it should seem, that the
Ministry were exasperated to a greater degree of rancor
than ever, and that they were thoroughly alarmed and determined
to throw the last die. Time and the events of
war will decide what will be the consequences of these
heated passions.</p>

<p>By a conversation this morning with the Viscount de
Noailles, I am led to fear, that the fleet from Brest will not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span>
be able to put to sea before the 10th of April. This will
be about the time the Marquis de Lafayette will arrive in
America. He sailed from Rochelle the 13th of this
month.</p>

<p>In the letter, which you did me the honor to write me
on the 24th of February, your Excellency proposed, that
the principal object of my mission should be inserted in
the Gazette of France, when it should make mention of
my presentation to the King and all the royal family.</p>

<p>In the answer to this letter, which I had the honor to
write on the 25th of February, I informed your Excellency,
that I should not think myself at liberty to make
any publication of my powers to treat of peace, until they
should have been announced in the Gazette. It was on
the 7th of March, that I had the honor to be presented to
the King and Royal Family, but no notice has been taken
of it in the Gazette of France. Whether the omission is
accidental, or whether it is owing to any alteration in your
Excellency's sentiments, I am not able to determine.</p>

<p>Your Excellency will excuse the trouble I give you on
this occasion, as it arises wholly from a desire to be able at
all times, to render an account to my sovereign of the

<h3>TO WILLIAM LEE.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">
Paris, March 21st, 1780.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Dear Sir,
</p>

<p>I have just received your favor from Brussels of the
17th of this month, and I thank you for this instance of
your attention to me.</p>

<p>Considering the state of Ireland, and the spirit that
seems to be rising in England, which has already attained
such a height, as to baffle the Minister, and the East India
Company, and to carry many votes in the House of Commons,
almost to a balance with him, and even some against
him, I should not be at all surprised, if terms, such as you
mention, should be offered to America; nor should I be
surprised if another rumor, which was propagated at the
Palais Royal this day, should prove true, that a great
change is made or to be made in the Ministry, and that the
Lords Shelburne and Rockingham, Burke, &amp;c. are in.
Yet I have no proper accounts of either.</p>

<p>Whatever may be my powers or instructions, or whether
I have any or not, I am very much obliged to you for
your sentiments on such a proposition as a truce for
America, supposing it should be made. Your arguments
are of great weight, and will undoubtedly be attended to
by every one, whoever he may be, who shall be called to
give an opinion upon such a great question. You will not
expect me at present to give, if it is proper for me even
to form, any decided opinion upon it. Yet thus much I
may venture to say, that having had so long an experience
of the policy of our enemies, I am persuaded, from the
whole of it, if they propose a truce, it will not be with an
expectation or desire, that America should accept it, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span>
merely to try one experiment more to deceive, divide, and
seduce, in order to govern.</p>

<p>You observe, that the heads of some well intentioned,
though visionary Americans, run much upon a truce. I
have seen and heard enough to be long since convinced,
that the Americans in Europe are by no means an adequate
representation of those on the other side of the
water. They neither feel, nor reason like them in general.
I should, therefore, upon all occasions hear their arguments
with attention, weigh them with care, but be sure never to
follow them, when I knew them to differ from the body of
their countrymen at home.</p>

<p>You say the Dutch are disturbed. Do you wonder at
it? They have been kicked by the English, as no reasonable
man would kick a dog. They have been whipped by
them, as no sober postillion would whip a hackney coach
horse. Can they submit to all this, upon any principle,
which would not oblige them to submit, if the English
were to bombard Amsterdam, or cut away their dikes?</p>

<p>I wish I knew the name of the principal confident and
director of the Prince, whom you mention.</p>

<p>I am very anxious to hear of the arrival of Mr Laurens,
but suspect you will learn it first. Mr Dana returns his
respects to you.</p>

<p>I thank you, Sir, for your offers of service; nothing can
oblige me more than to communicate to me any intelligence
of the designs of our enemies, in politics or war,
and their real and pretended forces by sea and land. Pray
what is the foundation of the story of a quintuple alliance
between Holland, Sweden, Russia, Prussia, and Denmark?</p>

<h3>TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">
Paris, March 23d, 1780.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,
</p>

<p>I have the honor to enclose the English papers of the
11th, 13th, and 14th of March, the <cite>Courrier de l'Europe</cite>,
and the Hague, Leyden, and Amsterdam Gazettes. We
are in hourly expectation of great news from Holland, Ireland,
England, Spain, and above all from America, and the
West Indies. I have not had a letter from America since
I left it, except one from my family of the 10th of December,
and, indeed, although several vessels have arrived, I
can hear of no letters or news.</p>

<p>By the English papers Congress will perceive the violent
fermentation in England, which has arisen to such a
height as to produce a Congress in fact, and it will soon be
so in name. The proceedings in the House of Commons
on the 14th, which were terminated by a resolution of the
committee of the whole house, to abolish the Board of
Trade and Plantations, carried against the Ministry after a
very long and warm debate, by a majority of eight voices,
is not only the most extraordinary vote, which has passed
in the present reign, but it tends to very extensive consequences.</p>

<p>I believe it is very true, that this Board has been the
true cause of the quarrel of Great Britain against the
Colonies, and therefore may be considered as an object of
national resentment, but a resentment of this kind alone
would not probably have produced this effect.</p>

<p>Whether it is the near approach of an election, that has
intimidated the members of the House of Commons, or
whether committees, petitions, associations, and Congress<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span>
have alarmed them, or whether the nation is convinced,
that America is indeed lost forever, and consequently the
Board of Trade would be useless, I do not know. Be
this as it may, the English nation, and even the Irish and
Scotch nations, and all parts of the world will draw this
inference from it, that even in the opinion of the House of
Commons America is lost. The free and virtuous citizens
of America, and even the slavish and vicious, if there are
any still remaining of this character, under the denomination
of tories, must be convinced by this vote, passed in
the hey-day of their joy for the successes of Admiral Rodney's
fleet, that the House of Commons despaired of ever
regaining America. The nations subject to the House of
Bourbon cannot fail to put the same interpretation upon
this transaction.</p>

<p>Holland and all the northern powers, with the Empress
of Russia at their head, who are all greatly irritated against
England for their late violences against the innocent commerce
of neutral powers, will draw the same consequences.
The politicians of Great Britain are too enlightened in the
history of nations, and the rise and progress of causes and
effects in the political world, not to see, that all these
bodies of people will, in consequence of this vote, consider
the Colonies given up as lost by the House of Commons,
and they are too well instructed, not to know the
important consequences that follow, from having such
points as those thus settled among the nations. I cannot,
therefore, but consider this vote, and the other respecting
the Secretary of State for the American Department, which
arose almost to a balance, as a decided declaration of the
sense of the nation. The first consequence of it probably
will be one further attempt, by offering some specious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span>
terms, which they know we cannot in justice, in honor, in
conscience, accept, to deceive, seduce, and divide America,
throw all into confusion there, and by this means gaining
an opportunity to govern. There is nothing more
astonishing than the inconsistencies of the patriots in England.
Those, who are most violent against the Ministry,
are not for making peace with France and Spain, but they
would wish to allure America into a separate peace, and
persuade her to join them against the House of Bourbon.
One would think it impossible, that one man of sense in
the world could seriously believe, that we could thus basely
violate our truth, thus unreasonably quarrel with our best
friends, thus madly attach ourselves to our belligerent
enemies. But thus it is.</p>

<p>Sir George Saville threw out in the House, that he
wished to carry home to his constituents the news of an
accommodation with America, and Mr David Hartley has
given notice of his intentions to make a motion relative to
us. But I confess I have no expectations. Mr Hartley's
motions and speeches have never made any great fortune
in the House, nor been much attended to; from whence I
conclude, if the present great leaders, even of opposition
in the House, were seriously disposed to do anything towards
a pacification, which we could attend to, they
would not suffer Mr Hartley to have the honor of making
the motion.</p>

<p>The heads of many people run upon a truce with America,
and Mr Hartley's motion may tend this way; but
a truce with America cannot be made without a peace
with France and Spain, and would America accept of such
a truce? Give Great Britain time to encroach and fortify
upon all our frontiers? To send enemies into the States,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span>
and sow the seeds of discord? To rise out of her present
exhausted condition? Suffer France and Spain to relax?
Wait for alterations by the death of Princes, or the changes
in the characters of Princes, or Ministers in Europe? I
ask these questions, that Congress may give me instructions,
if necessary. At present I do not believe my powers
are sufficient to agree to a truce, if it was proposed;
nor do I believe it would be for our interests or safety to
agree to it, if I had. I do not mean, however, to give
any decided opinion upon such a great question, in this
hasty letter; I am open to conviction, and shall obey the
instructions of Congress, with the most perfect respect.</p>

<p>
I have the honor to be, &amp;c.

informed of the items of it. But as it already appears,
that it strikes at the Department of Secretary of State for
America, and at the Board of Trade, there seems to be
little reason to doubt that it goes further, and strikes at the
American Board of Commissioners, at all the American
Judges of Admiralty, Governors of Provinces, Secretaries,
and Custom House Officers of all denominations. At
least, if this should not be found to be a part of the bill,
there are stronger reasons, if possible, for abolishing
this whole system of iniquity, together with all the pensions
granted to the refugees from America, than even for taking
away the Board of Trade. And from several late paragraphs
in the papers, and from Mr Fox's severe observations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span>
in the House of Commons upon Governor Hutchinson,
calling him in substance the "firebrand that lighted
up all the fire between the two countries," it seems pretty
clear, that it is in contemplation to take away all these
salaries and pensions.</p>

<p>If such a measure should take place, exiled as these
persons are from the country, which gave them birth, but
which they have most ungratefully endeavored to enslave,
they will become melancholy monuments of divine vengeance
against such unnatural and impious behavior. Nevertheless,
as these persons are numerous, and have some
friends in England as well as in America, where they had
once much property, there is a probability, I think, that
whenever or wherever negotiations for peace may be commenced,
they and their estates now almost universally confiscated,
will not be forgotten. But much pains and art
will be employed to stipulate for them in the treaty, both a
restoration of their property, and a right to return as citizens
of the States to which they formerly belonged. It is
very possible, however, that before the treaty shall be made,
or even negotiations commenced, these gentlemen will become
so unpopular and odious, that the people of England
would be pleased with their sufferings and punishment.
But it is most probable, that the Court will not abandon
them very easily.</p>

<p>I should, therefore, be very happy to have the explicit
instructions of Congress upon this head, whether I am to
agree, in any case whatsoever, to an article which shall
admit of their return, or the restoration of their forfeited
estates. There are sentiments of humanity and forgiveness
which plead on one side, there are reasons of state
and political motives, among which the danger of admitting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span>
such mischievous persons as citizens, is not the least considerable,
which argue on the other.</p>

<p>I shall obey the instructions of Congress with the utmost
pleasure, or if, for any reasons they choose to leave it at
discretion, if I ever should have the opportunity, I shall
determine it without listening to any passions of my own
of compassion or resentment, according to my best judgment
of the public good. There is another point of very
great importance, which I am persuaded will be aimed at
by the English Ministers, I am sure it will by the people of
England, whenever times of peace shall be talked of. For
facilitating the return of commerce, they will wish to have
it stipulated by the treaty, that the subjects of Great Britain
shall have the rights of citizens in America, and the
citizens of the United States the rights of subjects in the
British dominions. Some of the consequences of such an
agreement to them and to us are obvious and very important,
but they are so numerous, that it is difficult to
determine whether so great a question should be left to my
determination. If, however, contrary to my inclinations, it
should fall to my lot to decide it without instructions, it shall
be decided according to my conscience, and the best lights
I have.</p>

<h3>TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">
Paris, March 24th, 1780.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,
</p>

<p>It has been observed in former letters, that there is
scarcely an example of such a series of fortunate incidents
as that which happened to Rodney's fleet, and it may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span>
proper to dilate a little upon some of these incidents, to
show that the enthusiastic applause, which is given him by
the Court, the Lords, the Commons, and the city of London,
is no otherwise merited than by the boldness of his
enterprise; unless simple good fortune is merit.</p>

<p>It must be allowed, that it was a desperate plan in the
Minister to order him out on the design to succor Gibraltar,
and it was a desperate resolution in him to undertake
it; because he had to expect to meet with the whole
Spanish squadron at Cadiz, and that it would follow him,
which was in fact the case.</p>

<p>Don Gaston sailed from Brest the 13th of January in
search of Admiral Rodney, with twenty Spanish ships of the
line, with four French ships of the line, the Glorieux, the
Burgundy, the Zodiac, and the Scipio, with the frigate, the
Nereis, under the Chef d'Escadre, the Chevalier de Bausset.
If the four and twenty ships of the line had joined Don
Langara's squadron, there is scarce a possibility of doubt,
after the brave defence made by him, with such inferior
force, that Rodney's fleet would have been totally ruined,
and consequently Gibraltar reduced to extremities. But
this was not to happen. The next day after Don Gaston
sailed from Brest, he met with a terrible storm, which
separated his fleet. Two of his Spanish ships arrived at
Cadiz the 31st of January, the Serious and the Atlant,
each of seventy guns. The third of February there arrived
twelve others. The Rayo, commanded by Don Gaston,
and the St Louis, both of eighty guns, the Velasco,
the St Francis de Paule, the S. Isabella, the S. Joachim,
the St Peter, the St Damase, the Arrogant, and the
Warrior, all of seventy, the Mink of fiftysix, and the frigates,
the Assumption and the Emerald, with the French<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span>
division under the Chevalier de Bousset, excepting the
Scipio, commanded by the Baron de Durfort, which did
not arrive until the 17th of February, after having cruised
ten or twelve days off St Vincent, which had been appointed
as the place of rendezvous and reunion, in case of
separation. The Guardian Angel, of seventy guns, which
was also separated from the squadron, did not arrive till
several days after Don Gaston at Cadiz, having suffered
very much, as well as all the other vessels, in their masts
and rigging, by the bad weather, and especially by the violent
gale of wind, which they met with on the 1st of February,
near the Cape of St Vincent. Of the five remaining
Spanish vessels, four went into Ferrol, the St Vincent
Ferries, of eighty guns, commanded by Don d'Acre, Lieutenant
General; the St Charles, of eighty; the Vengeur,
of seventy, and the Septentrion, of sixty; the fifth, named
the St Joseph, of seventy, by Don Orsorno, Chef d'Escadre,
returned to Brest dismasted. This separation and
dispersion of the fleet and of its principal officers exposed
Langara, and made Rodney's fortune; and the necessity
these vessels were in of reparation, gave liberty to the English
fleet to put to sea from Gibraltar and regain the
Atlantic Ocean, on the 13th of February, to the number
of twentytwo ships of the line, including those of Rodney,
Digby, and Ross, and four of the vessels taken from the
Spaniards, and three frigates, with twelve merchant ships
under their convoy, leaving at Gibraltar, the Edgar, of
seventyfour, the Panther, of sixty, which has been there a
long time, and the Guipuscoa, of sixtyfour guns, taken
from the Spaniards on the 8th of January, with twentyfour
merchant vessels under her convoy.</p>

<p>There has been much conversation for several days, concerning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>
a Spanish armament preparing at Cadiz, and letters
from Carthagena say, that the regiment of infantry, called
the Flankers' regiment, which has been in garrison in that
city, has been completed by orders from the Court of Naples,
and on the 1st of March, the first battalion marched
for Cadiz, and on the 4th of March, the second battalion.
It is said that this regiment is to embark with several
others, which from different garrisons have arrived at the
same place for America, in all parts of which, according to
appearances, the English will have enough to do to maintain
their ground this ensuing campaign.</p>

<p>In Ireland, on the 22d of February, an assembly of the
gentlemen, clergy, and freeholders of the city of Dublin,
resolved unanimously, that the advantages obtained in commerce
are neither complete nor solidly established; that
the sense of the nation is, that the Irish Parliament alone,
in concert with the sovereign, can give to the laws already
obtained of the Prince their obligatory force; that what
has been done ought not to be considered as anything
more than a great beginning; and that the general hope
was, that the end of the session would be as advantageous
to the political constitution of the country, as the
commencement of it had been favorable to commerce; that
the fathers of the country are particularly requested and
instructed to obtain a declaratory act, which may preserve
forever the free and independent state of Ireland, and by
introducing some necessary modifications of Poyning's
law, to prevent in future all controversy between the
King and the Parliament of Ireland, concerning fundamental
laws.</p>

<p>These instructions were given by the sheriffs to the
representatives of Dublin, who answered that they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span>
convinced, that no foreign legislative power whatsoever
had any right, or ought to arrogate to itself any authority
over their nation, and without injuring the legal and known
authority, which his Majesty has a right to exercise over
this kingdom in a manner conformable to the laws, they
would neglect nothing to obtain an act, which should take
away every unjust restriction, and which should tend to assure
the constitutional independence of the kingdom. This
is said to be the general sense of the whole kingdom, so that
it may truly be said, that the British empire is crumbling
to pieces like a rope of sand, insomuch, that if the war
should continue, I shall not be at all surprised if even
Scotland should become discontented with the Union,
and the disputes between the Ministry and the East
India Company should terminate in the independence of
Asia; nay, it would be no miracle if the West India Islands
should request the protection of France and Spain,
or the United States. I will take the first opportunity to
write upon the subject of Lord North's loan, which, together
with the other ways and means, amounts to the
amazing sum of ¬£20,674,000 sterling.</p>

<h3>TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">
Paris, March 26th, 1780.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,
</p>

<p>On the 2d day of March the news of the royal consent
to the bill, which the British Parliament has passed for
granting to Ireland a free commerce with the American
Colonies, the West Indies, and the Coast of Africa, was
celebrated in Dublin by public rejoicings; the guns of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span>
Lark were discharged, the garrison made a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">feu de joie</i>,
the castle and other public buildings were illuminated,
as well as some private houses. The government were
probably encouraged to these demonstrations of joy, by
the motion, which was made the day before, that is, the 1st
of March, by Mr Dennis Doly in the House of Commons,
for an address of thanks to the King, to which both parties
unanimously consented, not excepting the principal patriots,
such as Mr Ogle, Mr Hussy Burgh, and Mr Grattan.</p>

<p>The address contains an assurance of their attachment
to the royal person and government of the King; a profession
of gratitude for his Majesty's uninterrupted attention
to the interest of Ireland, and for the happy alteration,
which the wisdom of his councils, and the liberal sentiments
of the British Parliament have effected in the situation
of their affairs. They express a double satisfaction
for the benefits, which have been granted them, because
they appear to them to be an efficacious remedy for the
poverty of that country, and because they furnish an unquestionable
proof of that fraternal affection, which they
think they have a right to expect from Great Britain, and
which they will constantly endeavor to cultivate and augment
to the most perfect degree of mutual confidence.
They profess the sincerest pleasure in finding that the ties,
which have ever united the two kingdoms, have been
bound faster than ever, by the conduct of their fellow subjects,
and they assure his Majesty, that on their part, they
will never fail to make the greatest efforts for the maintenance
of that close connexion between the two kingdoms,
which they firmly believe to be inseparable from their happiness
and prosperity.</p>

<p>The next day the House of Peers, even at the motion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span>
of the Duke of Leinster, followed the example of the
House of Commons. Their address is in substance the
same, with this addition, that the benefits received afford a
remedy proportioned to their distress, and that they will
discountenance with all their power all attempts, that deluded
men might make to excite ill founded apprehensions
in the people, and to turn their attention to the commerce,
which has been granted them in a manner so extensive.</p>

<p>To these additions, however, there was an opposition,
and finally a protest, signed by Lord Carrisford, the Earls
of Charlemont and Arran, and the Viscounts Powerscourt
and Mountmorris, and by the proxies of the Earl Moira,
and the Lords Eyre and Irnham.</p>

<p>The Duke of Leinster, however, has brought upon his
reputation by this motion suspicions all over Europe, that
he has been gained by the King, which a little time and
his future conduct will either dissipate or confirm.</p>

<p>The next day Parliament adjourned to the 11th of
April. Congress will be able to put a just interpretation
upon these addresses, by the account I gave in my last, of
the instructions of the city of Dublin to their representatives,
and their answer, as well as by those of the county
of Dublin, which remain to be communicated. On the
7th of March, there was held at Kilmainham, an assembly
of the freeholders of the county of Dublin, when the following
instructions to their representatives were agreed on.</p>

<p>"We, your constituents, desiring to acknowledge as we
ought, the advantages our commerce will derive from the
particular attention, which his Majesty has given it, from
the integrity of our Parliament, the firmness of our countrymen,
and the justice, which the English nation begins to
render us, we declare to you, that what follows is the principal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span>
cause of our joy upon this occasion. It appears to
us, that the desire of monopolising commerce was the only
motive, which could make England imagine that she had a
right to usurp a legitimate authority over this kingdom, and
from the moment when she renounced this monopoly, she
has taken away the principal obstacle, which opposed our
liberty, and consequently the British nation will not continue
to itself an arbitrary power, from which she can derive
nothing but reducing this kingdom to slavery. We
desire to know, moreover, whether the united efforts of the
Parliament and people of Ireland ought to confine themselves,
so as to leave this island in a state of dependence
and submission to laws, to which the nation has never consented,
to laws dictated by a Parliament, in which she has
no representatives? Let it not be said, that this power attributed
to the English Parliament is chimerical. We may
see the proofs of it even in the repeal of several of the acts
and in this, that several persons declare, however falsely,
that this power is founded upon law. Having an equal
right to political liberty and to commerce, but deprived of
both; and nevertheless content to be restored to the enjoyment
of a free commerce alone; will it not appear, that we
absolutely give up the former? This idea would be absurd.
It is then our duty to declare to the universe, that we are
of right a free nation, not to be subjected to any laws, but
such as are made by the King and Parliament of Ireland.</p>

<p>"Desirous of nothing so much as to live always in good
intelligence with the British nation, on account of the union
of the two Crowns, our instructions are, that you shall make
the greatest efforts to obtain an act, which shall establish
forever the independence of the legislative power of Ireland.
We wish, moreover, that you would endeavor to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span>
qualify Poyning's law, by taking away from the privy
council the legislative power. In accomplishing these important
objects, you will acquire honor to yourselves, and
give satisfaction to the nation.</p>

<p>"It is not to be doubted, that you will also fall upon
some plan of economy, by making savings, which are become
necessary to increase the revenue of the Crown, and
improve the commerce of the nation."</p>

<p>It seems now very plain, that the Irish nation aspires to
an independence of Great Britain the most unlimited,
and acknowledges no other connexion with her but that
of affection and a subjection to the same King. The
troops already raised by associations amount to between
sixty and seventy thousand men, which are to be forthwith
augmented by ten thousand more, who are to be formed of
countrymen; each officer is to furnish four, who will be
clothed and paid out of the funds, that each regiment will
establish for this purpose. The principal objects of these
armed associations are said to be, a free and unlimited
commerce to all parts of the world, except only the East
Indies. The repeal of Poyning's law, passed under
Henry the Seventh, and another under George the First,
which restrains the legislative authority of the Irish Parliament,
with an express clause, that the Parliament of Ireland
ought, and shall be forever and wholly exempt from
all kind of control and dependence of the British Parliament,
in all cases whatsoever. That students shall no
longer be obliged to go to the Temple in London, and
other seminaries in England to study law. But, in future,
they shall study in the University of Dublin, under proper
professors, and shall be admitted to the bar in Ireland by
the Lord Chancellor and the other judges, after a proper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span>
examination; the judges to be natives, except the
Chancellor; the bishops also to be natives.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the slightest circumstances may blow
up the flames of war between the two kingdoms, which
would have been done some weeks ago, if the regular
officers of the King's troops had not given way to the Dublin
volunteers.</p>

I have the honor to be, &amp;c.</p>

<h3>TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">
Paris, March 29th, 1780.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,
</p>

<p>I think it my duty to lay before Congress what may
occur in Holland, relative to the present war, at least until
the arrival of Mr Laurens, whose presence is much desired
there. Many appearances make it probable, that the
grasping and vindictive temper of the English will compel
the Republic into the war. If they do take a part, it is very
certain it will be against England. As plunder and revenge
are the present ruling passions of the English, it is
probable, that a war with Holland is rather wished for than
otherwise, because the Ministry and their principal supporters
seem to have no idea, that it is possible to make
things worse, and all the plunder they can get will be so
much clear gain. The Dutch are so much alarmed and
aroused, that it is very certain the Prince finds it necessary
to give out, that he has been deceived by the English, that
he has changed his sentiments, and that he will promote
with all his influence unlimited convoys. It is certain, that
they are fitting their men-of-war with a great deal of activity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span>
and it is confidently affirmed, that they have made a
treaty with Russia and Sweden, who are to make a common
cause. The States of the Province of Friesland have
come to a resolution, that it was certain Byland was not
the aggressor, but that Fielding had not hesitated to make
use of force to visit the Dutch ships under convoy, to stop
those that were loaded with hemp, and to insult the flag of
the Republic. That this proceeding shows, that the complaisance
hitherto shown to England, in depriving the ships
loaded with masts and ship timber of the protection of the
State, in leaving them to sail alone and without convoy, has
had no effects, and consequently the States judge, that a
similar condescension ought no longer to take place, but,
on the contrary, all merchandise whatsoever, which the
treaties do not expressly declare to be contraband, ought,
without the least difficulty, to be admitted under convoy,
and enjoy the protection of the State, and to this effect,
His Most Serene Highness ought to be requested to give
orders to the commanders of the men of war, and of the
squadron of the Republic, to protect, as heretofore, all
merchandise.</p>

<p>This resolution was taken the 29th day of February,
and laid before the States-General, who, after debating
upon it, determined to require the deputies of the other
Provinces to obtain, as soon as possible, the decision of
their Provinces upon the same subject. These two Provinces,
Holland and Friesland, have already decided for
unlimited convoys.</p>

<p>Sir Joseph Yorke, on the 21st of March instant, laid
before their High Mightinesses another Memorial, insisting
on the aid which he had demanded before, upon condition,
in case of refusal, that his master would, after three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span>
months consider all treaties between the two countries as
null, and in which he contends, that the protection afforded
to Captain Jones, whom he calls a pirate, in the Texel
and in Amsterdam, was a violation of the treaties.</p>

<p>In order more clearly to comprehend the dispute between
Great Britain and the States-General, it may not be
amiss to observe, that by the marine treaty between the
two powers, concluded at the Hague in 1667, all the subjects
and inhabitants of the United Provinces may, with all
safety and freedom, sail and traffic in all the kingdoms,
countries, and estates, which are, or shall be in peace,
amity, or neutrality with the States-General, without any
hinderance or molestation from the ships of war, gallies,
frigates, barques, or other vessels belonging to the King of
Great Britain, or any of his subjects, upon occasion or account
of any war, which may hereafter happen between
the King of Great Britain and the above said kingdoms,
countries, and estates, or any of them, which are, or shall
be, in peace, amity, or neutrality with the States-General;
and this freedom of navigation and commerce shall extend
to all sorts of merchandise, excepting contraband goods.
That this term of contraband goods, is to be understood to
comprehend all sorts of fire arms, their appurtenances, and
all other utensils of war called in French, "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">servans √†
l'usage de la guerre</i>," and that under this head of contraband
goods, these following shall not be comprehended;
corn, wheat, or other grain, pulse, oils, wine, salt, or generally
anything that belongs to the nourishment or sustenance
of life, but they shall remain free, as likewise all
other merchandise and commodities not comprehended in
the foregoing article, and the transportation of them shall
be permitted even into places at enmity with Great Britain,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span>
except such places are besieged, blocked up, or invested.
Masts, yards, ship timber, and hemp, the articles
now in dispute, are not contraband by this treaty, or by
the law of nations. Yet Great Britain, in the hours of her
insolence and madness, which are not yet at an end, makes
no scruple to seize, condemn, and confiscate them. She
pretends, that as the Dutch refuse to her the aid she demands
by treaty, she has a right to seize upon masts,
timber, and hemp, which are not prohibited by treaty.
Not to enter into the inquiry, whether the present case is
such, as by the treaties obliges the Dutch to furnish her
aid, but admitting for argument's sake it is so, yet the
consequences will not follow. It would only follow, that
Great Britain was absolved from the obligation of the
treaty, not by any means that she is discharged from the
obligations of the law of nations.</p>

<p>I have the honor to enclose to Congress copies of certain

Count de Vergennes, and of others, which I have received
from him.</p>

<p>It seems that the presentations of the American Commissioners

in the minds of some of our countrymen, as they thought
it a neglect of us, and a distinction between our sovereign

<p>I ought to confess to Congress, that the delicacy of the
Count de Vergennes about communicating my powers is
not perfectly consonant to my manner of thinking, and if I

<h3>TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">
Paris, March 30th, 1780.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,
</p>

<p>There is an anecdote, which causes a great speculation
at present, because it is supposed to show the tendency of
things in Ireland, and what is to be expected by Great Britain,
if the Ministry should oppose themselves to the wishes
of the Irish nation. On the 23d of February, three bodies
of volunteers, those of Dublin, commanded by Colonel
John Allen, those of the Liberties, commanded by Sir Edward
Newingham, and another body, commanded by Mr
Taylor, assembled at the Exchange, from whence they
made a long march in a circuit of four miles, accompanied
with other volunteers on horseback, to the Park, the
avenues of which were guarded by five other corps of
volunteers.</p>

<p>There they went through the man&oelig;uvres and firings,
with as much celerity and precision as any regular troops.
They were there reviewed by the Duke of Leinster, as
General and Commander-in-Chief, accompanied with four
Aids-de-Camps, and they all rendered to this nobleman
military honors almost equal to those which are rendered
to a King.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[447]</a></span>Returning from the review, the volunteers met in Barrack
street a detachment of the royal troops marching to
the castle. These required, that the volunteers should
turn out of the way, and endeavored to break their ranks;
but the volunteers, with their bayonets fixed and charged,
stood their ground and discovered such a resolution, that
the commanding officer of the King's troops ordered them
to halt, and desired to speak with the Duke of Leinster.
They entered into a conference. The regular troops pretended
they had a right to the pavements, as the troops of
the King. The volunteers, thought they had a right to
keep it, as free citizens, voluntarily armed for the defence
of their country, and consequently superior to mere mercenaries.
They supported these arguments by preparations
for battle, the people declared themselves in favor of
the volunteers, by collecting together a sufficient quantity
of stones, to overwhelm the troops, who at last gave way,
in order to avoid a scene of blood. The next day the
volunteers sent to the Viceroy an excuse, but couched in
terms, which justified their conduct as necessary to maintain
the liberty, independence, and dignity of the nation.
I have seen so much of the spirit of the King's troops, in
several contests between them and the citizens of Boston,
as to know very well what all this means. The volunteers
must have great confidence in their own strength, and the
King's troops equal diffidence of theirs, before an altercation
of this kind could terminate in this manner.</p>

<p>
I have the honor to be, &amp;c.</p>

<h3>TO ARTHUR LEE, AT L'ORIENT.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">
Paris, March 31st, 1780.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Dear Sir,
</p>

<p>I have received yours of the 26th, and that of the
15th of this month. I enclose a copy of the letter you
desire.</p>

<p>M. Garnier is gone into the country, and I have not
seen him since I arrived here. Mr Izard, however, has
seen him, and will give you a satisfactory account of what
he says.</p>

<p>If I were to apply to the other gentleman, you know
what would be the consequence. It would fly very soon
to, you know where, and I should have only the credit of
meddling unnecessarily with disputes, which I have kept
out of as much I could, and which it is certainly now the
public interest, and consequently my duty, to keep out of
as much I can. I had, therefore, rather be excused. The
gentleman himself would probably give you the same
answer to a letter from you directly to him, as he would
give to me, unless I should use arts with him; which would
be unworthy of you, as well as of me, and which I cannot
use with anybody.</p>

<p>I shall have enough to do, to steer my little bark among
the rocks and shoals. I shall have perplexities enough of
my own, which I cannot avoid, and dangers too. These
I shall meet with a steady mind, and perhaps none of them
will be greater than that, which I think my duty, of avoiding
things that do not belong to me.</p>

<p>Scarcely ever any Minister executed a commission for
making a peace, without ruining his own reputation, in a
free government. No Minister that ever existed, had a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[449]</a></span>
more difficult and dangerous peace to make than I have.</p>

<p>The gentleman you mention has hitherto been very still,
but he has been well received, by all that I have learnt.</p>

Adieu,</p>

<h3>TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">
Paris, April 3d, 1780.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,
</p>

<p>The Prince of Orange, Stadtholder, is not only supposed
to have ambitious views of allying his family to that
of Great Britain, but is very much influenced by the Duke
of Brunswick, who is a field marshal, and commander in
chief of the Dutch land forces, who is also a brother of
Prince Ferdinand. The Duke is not upon the best terms
with his family, because they think he is too much attached
to the House of Austria. By this double attraction of England
on one side, and their old friends the House of Austria
on the other, it is not very surprising that His Most Serene
Highness is drawn a little aside from the line of the American
cause, which is now so closely connected, and likely to
be more so, with the House of Bourbon. Hence it is said,
that the Count de Byland is to be honorably acquitted by
the court martial, and hence the embarrassments the
Dutch are under, in their wishes to resent like men the
unparalleled injuries, that have been done them by the English.
There is, however, so much spirit in the United
Provinces, as to oblige the Prince to put on the appearance
of resentment at the insults offered to his flag, and
to oblige the British Minister to assume the tone of menace,
in order to work upon the fears of the people, whose property<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[450]</a></span>
is so exposed as to make them dread a war with any
nation whatever.</p>

<p>Congress will, however, be able to judge of what is
doing in Holland by the following proceedings. A petition
was presented to their High Mightinesses on the 25th of
February, for the equipment of fiftytwo ships of war, in
the following terms.</p>

<p>"Your High Mightinesses having thought proper by
your resolution of the 17th of this month, which came to
us the 22d, to require us to present to your High Mightinesses,
without influencing, however, in anything the deliberations
of the confederates, a petition for the sum of
two million six hundred and twenty thousand five hundred
and ninetyeight florins, to assist towards the one half of the
necessary expense for an extraordinary equipment of fiftytwo
vessels of war and frigates, which are to be put in a
condition of service by the first of May, as well as of
other articles more fully particularised in the report contained
in the resolution of your High Mightinesses, and in
the estimate enclosed with it, which we flatter ourselves
were made with all possible accuracy, while the funds
necessary for the half of the equipment abovementioned,
will be found in the produce of certain duties.</p>

<p>"We have been the more zealous not to delay giving
satisfaction to the requisition of your High Mightinesses, as
we consider the said plan, as tending to accomplish what
has been for so many years represented and advised, as
well by His Serene Highness as by us, in general petitions
addressed successively to your High Mightinesses, as well as
to the confederates, that is to say, to put the Republic in a
more respectable state of defence, by augmenting her
marine and troops, an object upon which it has been again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[451]</a></span>
insisted in the petition of the current year, which employed
such reasons and such urgent motives to this purpose, that
expressions now fail us for adding anything to what has
been already said; and persuaded, moreover, as we are,
that the circumstances and facts, such of them as have
passed in a manner so remarkable, render useless and superfluous
all further reasonings, in such sort, that all these
details being already perfectly understood, as well by your
High Mightinesses as by the confederates, we think we
may depend upon this knowledge, in expectation of the
definitive resolutions of your High Mightinesses, equally
salutary and unanimous, and the effect of which will be to
prevent and ward off the new misfortunes, which may
threaten the Republic; assured, moreover, and persuaded,
that the serious intention of the confederates is to accomplish
the equipment proposed with all that depends upon
it, and that to this end, their High Mightinesses will be
pleased, not only to give their consent to the petition of
two millions six hundred and twenty thousand five hundred
and ninetyeight florins, formed by the present, but also,
what is more important, to furnish as soon as possible
their quota to the general treasury, by which means the
colleges of the Admiralty, whose duty it is to attend to the
equipments, may be possessed of the means necessary to
this operation at convenient periods; which will be thought
more indispensably necessary, on casting an eye on the
reasons more amply alleged in the report of the colleges of
the Admiralty, and expressed in the resolution of your
High Mightinesses, the 17th of February, to which we
refer."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[452]</a></span></p>


<h3>MEMORIAL.</h3>

<p>On the twentyfirst of March, 1780, Sir Joseph Yorke,
the British Ambassador, presented a Memorial to their
High Mightinesses, of the following tenor.</p>

<blockquote><p>"High and Mighty Lords,</p>

<p>"The King, my Master, has always cultivated the
friendship of your High Mightinesses, and has always considered
the alliance, which has so long subsisted between
the two nations, as founded upon the wisest principles, and
as essential to their mutual prosperity. The principal objects
of this alliance, which stands upon the immovable
basis of a common interest, are the safety and prosperity of
the two States, the maintenance of the public tranquillity,
and the preservation of that just balance so often disturbed
by the ambitious policy of the House of Bourbon. When
the Court of Versailles, in direct violation of the public faith,
and of the common rights of sovereigns, had broken the
peace, by a league made with the rebel subjects of his
Majesty, avowed and declared formally by the Marquis de
Noailles; when, by immense preparations, France manifested
her designs of annihilating the maritime power of England,
the King expected that your High Mightinesses, too
enlightened not to see, that the safety of the Republic is
closely connected with that of Great Britain, would have
been zealous to come to his assistance. One of the first
cares of his Majesty was, to inform your High Mightinesses
of all the circumstances of this unjust war; and in the critical
situation in which the King found himself he did not
forget the interests of his ancient allies; but, on the contrary,
has shown the most sincere desire to favor the commerce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[453]</a></span>
and the free navigation of the Republic, as much as
the safety of his people could permit. He even desisted a
long time from demanding the succors stipulated by the
treaties, fulfilling thus his own engagements, without insisting
on the accomplishment of those of your High Mightinesses.
The demand was never made, until after the united forces
of France and Spain showed themselves ready to fall upon
England, and there attempt a descent by the assistance of
a formidable fleet. Although frustrated in this enterprise,
the enemies of the King meditate still the same project;
and it is by the express order of his Majesty, that the
undersigned renews, at this time, in a manner the most
formal, the demand of the succors stipulated by different
treaties, and particularly by that of the year 1716.</p>

<p>"Hitherto your High Mightinesses have been silent upon
an article so essential; at the same time, you have insisted
on a forced construction of the treaty of commerce of the
year 1674, against the abuse of which Great Britain has
protested at all times. This interpretation cannot be reconciled
to the clear and precise stipulations of the secret
article of the treaty of peace of the same year. An article
of a treaty of commerce cannot annul an article so essential
of a treaty of peace, and both are expressly comprehended
in the principal treaty of alliance of 1678, by which your
High Mightinesses are obliged to furnish to his Majesty the
succors, which he now demands. You are too just and
too wise not to feel, that all the engagements between powers
ought to be mutually and reciprocally observed, and
although contracted in different periods, they oblige equally
the contracting parties. This incontestible principle applies
itself here with so much the more force, as the
treaty of 1716 renews all the anterior engagements between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[454]</a></span>
the Crown of England and the Republic, and incorporates
them, as it were, together.</p>

<p>"Moreover, the subscriber had orders to declare to your
High Mightinesses, that he was ready to enter into conferences
with you, to regulate in an amicable manner all
which might be necessary to avoid misunderstandings, and
prevent every disagreeable occurrence, by concerting measures
equitable and advantageous for the respective subjects.</p>

<p>"This friendly offer was refused, in a manner as unexpected
as it was extraordinary and unusual among friendly
powers; and without taking notice of repeated representations,
both public and secret, upon the subject of convoys,
your High Mightinesses have not only granted convoys
for different kinds of naval stores, but you have moreover
expressly resolved, that a certain number of vessels of war
should be held ready to convoy in the sequel naval stores
of every species, destined for the ports of France; and
this at a time when the subjects of the Republic enjoyed
by the force of treaties, a freedom and an extent of commerce
and of navigation far beyond that, which the law
of nations allows to neutral powers. This resolution, and
the orders given to Admiral Byland, to oppose himself by
force to the visits of merchant ships, have given place to
the incident, which the friendship of the King would have
greatly desired to have prevented; but it is notorious, that
this Admiral, in consequence of his instructions, first fired
upon the sloops bearing the English flag, which were sent
to make the visit in the manner prescribed by the treaty of
1674. It was then a manifest aggression, a direct violation
of the same treaty, which your High Mightinesses
seem to look upon as the most sacred of all. His Majesty
has made beforehand repeated representations of the necessity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[455]</a></span>
and justice of this visit, practised in all similar circumstances,
and fully authorised by this treaty. They
were informed in London, that there were in the Texel
a great number of vessels loaded with naval stores, and
particularly with masts and large ship timber, ready to set
sail for France immediately after, or under, a Dutch convoy.
The event has but too fully proved the truth of
these informations, since some of these vessels have been
found even under this convoy. The greatest number have
escaped, and have carried to France the most efficacious
succors, of which she stood in the greatest necessity.</p>

<p>"At the same time your High Mightinesses thus aided
the enemy of the King, by favoring the transportation of
these succors, you imposed a heavy penalty upon the subjects
of the Republic, to restrain them from carrying victuals
to Gibraltar, although this place was comprehended
in the general warranty of all the British possessions in
Europe, and although at that time Spain had vexed the
commerce of the Republic, in a manner the most outrageous
and unexampled.</p>

<p>"It is not only on these occasions, that the conduct of
your High Mightinesses towards the King, and towards the
enemy of his Majesty, forms a most striking contrast in the
eyes of all the impartial world. No one is ignorant of
that, which passed in the too well known affair of Paul
Jones. The asylum granted to this pirate was directly
contrary to the treaty of Breda, of 1667, and even to the
proclamation of your High Mightinesses of 1776. Further,
although your High Mightinesses have kept, and still
keep a silence the most absolute, with regard to the just
demands of his Majesty, you have been forward, at the
simple request of the King's enemies, to assure them of an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[456]</a></span>
absolute and unconditional neutrality, without any exception
of the ancient engagements of the Republic, founded
upon the most solemn treaties. Nevertheless the King
would still persuade himself, that all which has passed ought
to be attributed less to the disposition of your High Mightinesses,
than to artifices of his enemies, who, after having
excited discord among the members of the State, seek alternately
by menaces and by promises to animate them
against their natural ally. His Majesty cannot believe,
that your High Mightinesses have taken the resolution to
abandon a system, which the Republic has pursued for
more than a century, with so much success and so much
glory.</p>

<p>"But if such was the resolution of your High Mightinesses,
if you were determined to forsake the alliance with
Great Britain, in refusing to fulfil the engagements of it,
there would arise from this resolution a new order of
things. The King would perceive such an alteration with
a sensible regret; but the consequences, which would follow
from it, would be necessary and unavoidable. If by
an act of your High Mightinesses, the Republic should
cease to be the ally of Great Britain, the relations between
the two nations will be totally changed, and they will no
longer have any other ties or relation than those, which
subsist between nations neutral and friendly. Every
treaty being reciprocal, if your High Mightinesses will not
fulfil your engagements, the consequence will be, that
those of his Majesty will cease to be obligatory. It is in
pursuance of these incontestible principles, that his Majesty
has ordered the subscriber to declare to your High Mightinesses,
in a manner the most friendly, but at the same
time the most serious, that, if contrary to his just expectations,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[457]</a></span>
your High Mightinesses do not give him, within the
term of three weeks, to be computed from the day of presentation
of this memorial, a satisfactory answer, touching
the succors demanded eight months ago, his Majesty, considering
this conduct as a departure from the alliance on
the part of your High Mightinesses, will no longer consider
the United Provinces in any other light than that of other
neutral powers not privileged by treaties, and consequently
will, without further delay, suspend conditionally, and until
further orders, in regard to their subjects, all the particular
stipulations of the treaties between the two nations,
particularly those of the treaty of 1674, and will hold himself
simply bound by the general principles of the law of
nations, which ought to serve as rules between powers
neutral and not privileged.</p>

<p class="signature">
JOSEPH YORKE."
</p></blockquote>

<p>On the 24th of March, the States-General made the
following answer to Sir Joseph Yorke.</p>

<blockquote><p>"That their High Mightinesses had resolved to represent
to his Britannic Majesty by the Count de Welderen,
their Envoy Extraordinary, that having seen by the memorial
of the Ambassador, dated the 21st of March, that
his Majesty fixed a term of three weeks to have a satisfactory
answer touching the succors demanded, their High
Mightinesses wished to satisfy, as soon as possible, the
desires of his Britannic Majesty, by giving him a positive
answer; but they foresaw, that the form of government
inherent in the constitution of the Republic would not
permit them to complete their answer in the time specified,
as the memorial of the Ambassador, having become an
object of the deliberations of the representative Provinces,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[458]</a></span>
it was necessary to wait the resolution of the several
States, the Assemblies of which were now sitting, or about
to sit; that their High Mightinesses assured themselves, that
his Majesty, considering these reasons, would not persist
rigorously in the time fixed, to the end, that their High
Mightinesses might have that of forming in a manner conformable
to the constitution of the Republic (in which their
High Mightinesses had not a right to make any alteration)
an answer to the memorial of the Ambassador, their High
Mightinesses promising to neglect nothing for accelerating,
as much as possible, the deliberations upon the subject,
and they pray the Ambassador to support these representations,
with his good offices, with the King, his master."</p></blockquote>

<p>Sir Joseph Yorke, after reading this answer, replied, that
whatever might be his desire to satisfy the inclinations of
their High Mightinesses, the orders of the King, his master,
would not permit him upon this occasion; that, however,
he doubted not, that they would be equally satisfied
by the representations with which their High Mightinesses
had charged the Count de Welderen at the Court of
London.</p>

<p>
I have the honor to be, with great respect, &amp;c.</p>

<h3>TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">
Paris, April 3d, 1780.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,
</p>

<p>The fermentation in England has already distressed the
administration and overawed some of the members of the
House of Commons, but there is room to suspect, that this
is chiefly to be attributed to the approach of an election.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[459]</a></span>
The petitions are very far from being universal, and the
congress of the sub-committees is not yet numerous.</p>

<p>At a meeting of these from York, Surry, Middlesex,
Sussex, Gloucester, Hertford, Kent, Huntington, Dorset,
Bucks, Chester, Devon, and Essex, from the cities of
London, Westminster, Gloucester, and the towns of Newcastle
and Nottingham, holden at the St Albans tavern,
and afterwards by adjournment at the great room in King
Street, St James, on the 11th, 14th, 15th, 17th, 18th, and
20th days of March, 1780, the Reverend Christopher
Wyvill in the chair, a memorial was agreed on, containing
reasons for a plan of association.</p>

<p>They affirm that there is a despotic system, and they
date the commencement of it nearly from the beginning of
the present reign, and they say that they have arrived at
the crisis, which the wisest of the political writers marked
for the downfall of British liberty, when the legislative
body shall become as corrupt as the executive, they should
have said more corrupt, because that is undoubtedly the
fact at present, as well as the case stated by Montesquieu.</p>

<p>They say, that by the unhappy war with America, begotten
in the first instance of this despotic system, and
nursed with a view of giving completion to it, the fatal influence
of the Crown has been armed with more ample
means for enslaving Parliament, while the nation has visibly
sunk almost into beggary. Never did any country
experience so sudden a reverse from prosperity to depression.
They state the fall of rents, the accumulation of
taxes, and the stagnation of all credit. They then run a
long course of reasoning, to show the utility, importance,
and necessity, of the several things they recommended to
the people of England, which are all comprehended in a
few propositions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[460]</a></span>1st. They recommend perseverance in the petitions,
and an association in support of them.</p>

<p>2dly. A new law for taking the suffrages of the people
at elections, to prevent expense and influence.</p>

<p>3dly. To adopt, as part of their general associations,
the following propositions.</p>

<p>I. That an examination be made into all the branches
of the receipt, expenditure, and mode of keeping and
passing accounts of public money.</p>

<p>II. One hundred, at least, of additional members of
counties in the House of Commons.</p>

<p>III. That the members of the House of Commons be
<em>annually elected</em>.</p>

<p>IV. That it is recommended to all voters to support,
at the next election, such candidates as shall, by signing
the association or otherwise, satisfy them that they will support
these regulations in Parliament.</p>

<p>In the Middlesex committee, at the Masons' tavern,
March 24th, this circular letter and the memorial it contained
were unanimously approved, and their members in
the general Congress thanked. In the Westminster committee,
King's Arms tavern, Palace yard, March 15th,
1780, it was resolved, "that by the resolution of the general
meeting, directing this committee to prepare a plan of association
on legal and constitutional grounds, to support the
laudable reform, and such other measures as may conduce
to restore the freedom of Parliament, this committee conceive
themselves bound to enter into the consideration of
every question tending to establish the independency of Parliament
on a solid and durable basis. That the duration of
Parliament, and the state of the representatives of the people,
are questions immediately under this description; that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[461]</a></span>
a sub-committee, consisting of seven persons, be appointed to
inquire into the state of the representation of the nation and
make a report." On the 20th of March, the sub-committee
reported. The report is dated the 19th. "That new Parliaments
to be holden once in every year were the ancient
usage, and declared to be the hereditary and indefeasible
right of the people of England; that the 6th of William
and Mary is the first, which attempts to appoint the time
of the continuance of Parliament to be for the term of
three years, though the same act recognises the ancient laws
and statutes of this kingdom, by which annual Parliaments
were confirmed, and declares that frequent and new Parliaments
tend very much to the happy union and good agreement
of the King and people; that by the 1st of George
the First, the Parliament then chosen for three years, (by
acquiescence of the people to the act of William and
Mary, on the faith of its declaring, that from henceforth,
no Parliament whatsoever, that shall at any time hereafter
be called, assembled, or held, shall have any continuance
for longer than three years only at the furthest,)
did pass an act to prolong its continuance to seven years;
that temporary considerations are stated in the preamble
to the act, as the principal motives for the act itself, that
the 6th of William and Mary is worded as if declaratory
of what was conceived, however falsely, to have been the
constitution of the country; but that the septennial act assumes
a power of altering the duration of Parliament at
pleasure; that these alterations in the constitution of Parliament
were made without communication with the constituent
body of the people, and have been continued without
the sanction of their approbation; that the septennial
bill was strongly opposed in Parliament, and a direct infringement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[462]</a></span>
on the constitution, and a flagrant breach of
trust towards the constituent body; that it was supported
almost entirely on the principle of expediency; that the
voice of the people appeared strongly against it, in many
respectable petitions to Parliament on the occasion, and
that a constitutional protest was entered by the Peers,
stating, that frequent Parliaments were the fundamental
constitution of the kingdom; that the House of Commons
ought to be chosen by the people, and when continued for
a longer time than they were chosen for, they were then
chosen by the Parliament and not by the people; that they
conceived the bill, so far from preventing corruption,
would rather increase it, for the longer a Parliament was
to last, the more valuable to corrupt ones would be the
purchase, and that all the reasons which had been given
for long Parliaments might be given for making them perpetual,
which would be an absolute subversion of the third
estate; that various motions were afterwards made and
strongly supported for a repeal of the septennial act,
particularly a motion for annual Parliaments in 1774, which
was lost only by a majority of thirtytwo; that the city of
London and other respectable bodies continued to instruct
their representatives to prosecute this object in the most vigorous
manner, as essentially necessary to the independency
and integrity of Parliament, the rights of the people, and
the prosperity of their country; that by the 8th of Henry
Sixth, the Parliament, then elected by the commonality at
large, passed an act to disfranchise the greater part of their
constituents, by limiting the right of election of Knights of
the Shire to persons having free lands, or tenants, to the
value of forty shillings by the year, at the least, which restriction
has ever since continued; that many towns and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[463]</a></span>
boroughs, formerly entitled for their repute and reputation,
to send members to Parliament, have since fallen into decay,
yet continue to have a representation equal to the
most opulent counties and cities, while other towns and
places, which have risen into consideration, and become
populous and wealthy, have no representatives in Parliament;
that the number of the inhabitants of England and
Wales is above five millions; that of these, twelve hundred
thousand are supposed capable of voting, as the constitution
stood before the restrictive act above quoted; that not
more than two hundred and fourteen thousand are at present
permitted to vote; that out of these, one hundred and
thirty thousand freeholders elect ninetytwo members for
fiftytwo counties; fortythree thousand citizens, freemen
and others, elect fiftytwo members for twentythree cities
and two universities, and fortyone thousand electors choose
three hundred and sixtynine members for one hundred and
ninetytwo towns and boroughs; that fifty of these members
are returned by three hundred and forty electors; and a
number scarcely above six thousand, being a majority of
the voters of one hundred and twentynine of the boroughs,
return two hundred and fiftyseven representatives, which is
a majority of the whole English House of Commons, and
the efficient representation of above five millions of people;
that many of these boroughs are immediately under the
influence of the Crown, as the cinque ports; many of
them are private property, affording hereditary seats, as
those under burgage, tenure, and some of them almost
without houses or inhabitants, as Galton, Newtown, and
Old Sarum; that considering the representation with
reference to property, many counties return representatives
out of all proportion to what they contribute to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[464]</a></span>
public revenue; that Cornwall pays to land tax and subsidy,
sixteen parts out of five hundred and thirty, and
sends fortyfour members to Parliament, while Middlesex
pays not less in proportion than two hundred and fiftysix,
and sends eight members; so that the inequality of the
representation of this country, with regard to property, is
still greater than when estimated according to the numbers
of its inhabitants." The Westminster committee after considering
this report, Mr Fox in the chair, came to the following
resolutions.</p>

<p>"1. That annual Parliaments are the undoubted right of
the people of England, and that the act which prolonged
their duration was subversive of the constitution, and a
violation on the part of the representatives, of the sacred
trust reposed in them by their constituents.</p>

<p>"2. That the present state of the representation of this
country is inadequate to the object, and a departure from
the first principles of the constitution.</p>

<p>"3. That thanks be given to the sub-committee for their
very intelligent report.</p>

<p>"4. That copies of it be sent to the several committees
of the counties, cities, and boroughs of the kingdom."</p>

<p>I have been thus particular in stating the proceedings of
these committees, because it must be an advantage for
Congress to have them all in view, and to see the whole of
the foundation that is laid. They are some of the most
important proceedings of the present reign; they are the
commencement of a new sovereignty in opposition to the
old. If there is virtue or good sense in the nation, these
machines will discover it and set it in motion, and provided
the war continues, it will prevail; but if there is neither
virtue or sense remaining, or not enough of these to produce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[465]</a></span>
the desired effect, it will probably be the last national
effort made in favor of liberty, and despotism will range at
large.</p>

<p>If the King would make peace now, he would dissipate
all these combinations in England, Ireland, and Holland, as
well as prevent the treaty with Spain, (which I believe is in
a good way, from a letter which I lately saw from Mr
Carmichael,) from giving advantages, to Spain, and disadvantages
to England, which can never be altered. But if
he continues the war long, if he should have signal successes,
these may dispel the storms in England and Ireland;
but if he should be unsuccessful, the new sovereignty
will probably prevail against him, after involving the three
kingdoms in confusion and blood.</p>

<p>
I have the honor to be, &amp;c.</p>

<h3>TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">
Paris, April 4th, 1780.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,
</p>

<p>There is an anecdote from Malaga, which ought to be
mentioned to Congress, because, it cannot fail to have
serious consequences.</p>

<p>The Swedish frigate, the Illerim, of thirtyfour guns,
commanded by Captain Ankerloo, on the 28th of February,
at half after eight o'clock at night met an English privateer
belonging to Minorca, of twentyeight guns. The
Swedish Captain, after hailing the privateer, let her continue
her course, and went on quietly his own; about half
an hour after the privateer returning, ranged herself astern
of the frigate, and unexpectedly discharged both his broadsides,
loaded with langrage, which killed three sailors,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[466]</a></span>
broke the thigh and the right leg of the Captain, wounded
the Lieutenant and some people of the crew. Ankerloo,
who in the evening had been obliged by a violent gale of
wind to draw in his guns and shut up his ports, not finding
himself prepared for battle, his officers took immediate
measures, with the utmost alertness, for repulsing the
privateer, which did in fact at last receive one broadside
from the frigate; but, upon the whole, she escaped in the
night, by the force of sails and of oars. After this perfidy
on the part of the English, Ankerloo would have entered
Marseilles for the sake of dressing his wounds, but having
met with contrary winds and bad weather for three days,
he put into Malaga, where he went ashore to the house
of the Swedish consul, where he is since dead of his
wounds.</p>

<p>
I have the honor to be, with the greatest respect, &amp;c.</p>

<h3>TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">
Paris, April 6th, 1780.
</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,
</p>

<p>It may be necessary to transmit the decree of Sir James
Mariott, against the Dutch ship la Sybellina Hillegonda,
in order fully to comprehend the proceedings, which I have
sent before. The decree is this.</p>

<p>"The fact in this case is, a Dutch ship loaded with naval
stores, for a port in France, under the convoy of not less
than five men-of-war, and the commander of these men-of-war,
not measuring his conduct by the line of the treaty,
resists, fires upon the boat of the English Commodore,
and forbids the execution of the treaty. The English<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[467]</a></span>
Commodore returns the fire. The Dutch Admiral fires
again, and strikes; so that the fact is to be adjusted, and
it is of such a nature as has never before happened in the
history of this nation. It falls unfortunately to my share,
to decide upon these facts and their consequences.</p>

<p>"It is, nevertheless, a consolation, that although the
judge of this court may decide, in the first instance, there
is still a superior tribunal, in the last resort. This court
ought to judge of the case of the treaty, since, in virtue
of a special commission, under the great seal of the kingdom,
the judges of the courts of admiralty are authorised
and required to take cognizance of, and proceed judicially
in all manner of captures, seizures, prizes, and reprisals,
and decide upon them according to the course of
the admiralty and the law of nations.</p>

<p>"The claimant disdains to found his right in any other
way than upon the treaty. My idea is, that all the marine
treaties, which subsist between two friendly powers, form
but one code of laws, one great confederation, one indivisible
union. They are, if it is lawful to make use of these
sacred words, the Bible, the Book, or the Testament of the
social contract between the nations, to be maintained inviolably,
as a system, whereof we cannot break one part without
dissolving the whole.</p>

<p>"The Dutch subjects have, in virtue of the treaty, particular
privileges, superior to those of every other country,
but they may overleap the bounds of these privileges, and
from that time they ought to be weighed in the balance,
like other neutral nations. To be found under a convoy
is not, in itself, an infraction of the treaty, but the conduct
of this convoy is to be considered.</p>

<p>"The fifth article of the treaty of 1674 is reciprocal.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[468]</a></span>
'If any ship, belonging to the subjects of his Majesty of
Great Britain, shall in open sea, or elsewhere, out of the
dominions of the said States, meet any ships of war of the
Lords the States, or privateers belonging to their subjects,
the said ships of the Lords the States, or of their subjects,
shall keep at a convenient distance, and only send out
their boat, with two or three men only, to go on board such
ships or vessels of the subjects of his Majesty, in order
that the passport, or sea-brief, concerning the property
thereof, according to the form hereunder annexed, may be
produced to them, by the captain or master of such ship
or vessel, belonging to the subjects of his Majesty; and
the said ships, so producing the same, shall freely pass;
and it shall not be lawful to molest, search, detain, or
force such ship from her intended voyage. And the subjects
of the Lords the States shall enjoy in all things, the
same liberty and immunity, they in like manner showing
their passport, or sea-brief, made out according to the
form prescribed at the foot of this treaty.'</p>

<p>"The sixth article is, 'If any ship or vessel, belonging
to the English or other subjects of Great Britain, shall be
met making into any port belonging to an enemy of the
Lords the States, or, on the other side, if any ship belonging
to the United Provinces of the Netherlands, or other
subjects of the Lords the States, shall be met in her way,
making into any port under the obedience of the enemies
of his said Majesty, such ships shall show, not only a passport,
or sea-brief, according to the form hereunder subscribed,
wherewith she is to be furnished, but also her certificate
or cocket, containing the particulars of the goods
on board, in the usual form, by the officers of the customs
of that port, from whence she came; whereby it may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[469]</a></span>
known whether she is laden with any of the goods prohibited
by the third article of this treaty.'</p>

<p>"Such are the terms of this treaty, which this court
will not declare to be now in force; but one of the
parties may renounce it; and it would be from that
time, so far forth, a good cause of annulling it. It could
not ever have been the intention of the contracting parties,
that the merchant ships of the subjects of the States
should become the transport vessels for the service of the
King of France, nor that the men-of-war of the States
should serve as a convoy to them. It is impossible to
form an idea more unworthy of the sovereignty of the
States. The idea of granting a convoy to all Dutch ships
destined for the port of an enemy is offensive, and still
more aggravating, when accompanied with resistance, or
orders to resist, when they go so far as to reject <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ipso facto</i>
all the ordinary ways of public justice, and to set at nought
the articles, which had been established to prevent the
consequences of the intervention of neuters, as parties in a
war, by public acts; articles which stipulate a legal procedure
for discussing all the points in controversy, before the
courts of admiralty reciprocally; and in case the parties
should not be satisfied, they ought to be finally heard by
their respective sovereigns in council. Such is the tenor
of the twelfth article of the treaty of 1674.</p>

<p>"In the present state of the cause, this court will not
say, nevertheless, that the States have annulled the treaty;
because the orders of Admiral Byland have not appeared,
and his conduct may be disavowed by the States; but
even the granting of a convoy, and above all of a squadron,
is essentially offensive, since the Dutch subjects are
already sufficiently armed by the treaty, and by the methods<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[470]</a></span>
of redress prescribed, which are the same with all
maritime nations. The party complaining follows the ship
and the papers, which she has on board, into the jurisdiction
of the place and country where he is carried, as the
subject, who in the nature of things and proceedings, can
only of necessity be judged there, where the original proofs
exist; the judges specially constituted, for the decision of
prizes, both in the first instance and in the last resort, are,
by common consent, charged to hear and determine all
national differences between powers who are friends and
allies, like the Council of Amphyctions in ancient Greece.
But seamen do not well comprehend this language. They
speak roughly, like the mouths of their cannons. If this
vessel had fired upon the boat, and any one had thereby
lost his life, I think I should not have hesitated to condemn
her upon general principles. Neither Admiral Byland, nor
his instructions, are before me. I know not how to give a
sentence against him or his vessels; nevertheless, he ought
not to have fired upon the boat of Commodore Fielding;
but he was bound to send to him his boat, and to propose
an interview and an amicable conference. He might have
made him a visit, which he immediately would have returned;
and all the captains of the Dutch merchant ships
might have been ordered on board the English Commodore,
to produce their passports and cockets. The effect
of his resistance is thus the cause, that, although I do not
declare the treaty null generally, nevertheless, in retaliation
to these vessels taken in time of resistance, I ought to declare
the ship forfeited of its privilege, and foreclosed of
the treaty, by the act of M. Byland. There was certainly
never any vessel under convoy without instructions,
at least in her course, and without signals. If the claimants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[471]</a></span>
had not withheld them, it would have appeared, whether
the Dutch Admiral ought, or ought not to have escorted
these ships even into the ports of France, which would
have aggravated the offence against the treaty. A convoy
of a single ship, destined for the States, destined for the
Colonies of the States, or loaded generally with innocent
commodities, is, in itself, inoffensive; because, in these
times, there are in all the seas little pirates, furnished with
all sorts of commissions, American, French, Spanish, and
English; but a squadron of a line of battle ships, and which
appears force [?] even to the treaty, which they claim
the benefit of, is a serious affair. To engage in hostilities
is not the way of protecting commerce; and those who
have solicited the States to grant such a convoy, were
rather factious Americans, or intriguing French politicians,
than solid, sensible Dutchmen, true and real friends
of their country. There is certainly among them a number
of worthy people, who can never desire to become, in
fact, a Province, under the obedience of the King of
France, or his resident Minister.</p>

<p>"The case of the Swedish convoy is not applicable to this
case. That convoy had not made any resistance. The
ships entered the Downs by the bad weather, and were
there taken without their convoy, which came to anchor
near them. This was represented, and the course of
justice was followed. The ship's papers were produced
directly in this court, the requisites were done, and the
causes finally discussed according to the style of the admiralty,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="l">velo levato</i>; no time was lost, either in contesting
the justice or demanding right; and the captains of the
ships returned contented with their vessels after they had
been paid the freight, as well as the expense; and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[472]</a></span>
naval stores, which they had on board, were purchased by
the government, by virtue of powers granted to the Council
of the Royal Marine, by act of Parliament, in conformity
to acts of Parliament in former wars.</p>

<p>"The question, whether the hemp and flax are contraband,
is clear. Both of them have been adjudged such on
all former occasions, when the quantity has been considerable,
and particularly, when they are not of the produce
of the country of the party which carries them. The flax
is as necessary for sails, as the hemp for cordage; and if
this court has once ordered that flax should be sold to the
Commissioners of the navy, it was because it was of little
value, and in very small quantity. I am sorry to learn,
that the Navy Board makes any difficulty upon this subject.
The iron on board was only for ballast."</p>

<p>I cannot go through with the whole of this decree for
want of time; but the following curious and convenient
doctrine ought not to be omitted.</p>

<p>"That, which in the natural or intellectual world is
called quality, is not relative. Good and evil are relative.
Everything is what it is, and acquires its denomination
from comparison, degree, manner, quality, place, time,
person, fault, &amp;c. &amp;c. These relations constitute the metaphysical
essence of every complex idea in the human understanding.
Hence that source, without end, of disputes,
the glory of the bar, and of the schools of philosophy.</p>

<p>"Grotius and Bynkershoeck agree, and who is there
that will deny, that necessity gives a right to make ourselves
masters of everything, without the seizure of which
a nation cannot defend herself? As in relation to want, if
the enemy, on one part, is in want of stores, the want to
intercept them on the other is equal. And in relation to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[473]</a></span>
blockades, every port of the enemy is blocked relative to a
neutral vessel loaded with stores, which is seized, and, by
consequence, blocked, or hindered to go there. It imports
little, that whether the blockade be made across the
narrows at Dover, or off the harbor at Brest, or L'Orient.
If you are taken, you are blocked. Great Britain, by her
insular situation, blocks naturally all the ports of Spain and
France. She has a right to avail herself of this situation,
as a gift of Providence.</p>

<p>"In fine, it is necessary to observe, that the claimants,
founding themselves upon the privilege of the treaty, have
not a single paper on board to prove the property of the
cargo, in which respect all are defective. The sentence
then, is, that, under the circumstances of this case, the
claim of privilege is rejected, and that the Dutch master
be enjoined to produce his sailing orders, and certificates
and cockets from the Custom House of the port from
whence the ship sailed, according to the stipulations of the
sixth article of the treaty of 1674. The hemp and flax
are condemned as contraband on board of this ship, and
the owners of the iron are held to prove their property."</p>

<p>I have the honor to be, with the greatest respect, Sir,
your most obedient and most humble servant,</p>

<h3>TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">
Paris, April 7th, 1780.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,
</p>

<p>There are several articles of intelligence today, which
are connected with the subject of my letter of yesterday.
One is from the Hague, the 2d of April. "Thursday night<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[474]</a></span>
last two couriers from Petersburgh arrived here, alighted
at the hotel of the Prince Gallitzen, the Envoy Extraordinary
of her Majesty the Empress of all the Russias to the
States-General. One of the couriers set off immediately
for London, to the Russian Minister who resides there.
The Prince Gallitzen having been in conference the next
day with the President of the Assembly of their High
Mightinesses, relative to the said despatches, this Minister
sent back, the next night after his arrival, the same courier.
From that time the report runs, that the object of these
despatches was to communicate to the Republic the
measures taken by Russia, with some of the northern
powers, for ensuring respectively the safety of the navigation
and commerce of their subjects, and to invite the
States-General to enter into the same arrangements."</p>

<p>The other is from Constantinople, the 14th of February.
"The privateers continue to vex the neutral ships in the
seas of the Grand Seignior, by visiting and stopping them
wherever they find them, and even without any discretion,
at the entry of the ports and under the guns of our fortresses.
The French frigate, the Gracieuse, which lay at anchor in
the road of Cyprus, having learned that an English privateer
had brought into the port of this island a French
prize, sent to her some boats armed to retake her, which
they could not accomplish, however, without having some
men killed on both sides. The English consul having
carried his complaints to the government of the Island, of a
violation of the laws of nations and demanded assistance, he
was so well succored, that the French were obliged to
abandon the prize, and all of their nation who were in the
island came very near being massacred by the Turks.
As the Porte has also been informed, that on the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[475]</a></span>
hand the ship Smyrna, of Rotterdam, has run a risk of
undergoing the same fate with the ship of Captain Kinder,
of Amsterdam, and perhaps to suffer treatment still harder,
and in sight of the city of Smyrna; she has not only resolved
to send new orders to all the commandants, to enjoin
them very seriously to observe a neutrality the most exact,
by fulfilling their duty, but she has also testified her sensibility
in regard to all these depredations to the Ambassadors
of the Courts of France and England, by sending to
them last Saturday a representation in writing, purporting,
that as the Porte had not failed to observe, during the war
between France and England, an exact and perfect neutrality
to facilitate their commerce upon an equal footing,
and to afford to their ships all possible safety in her seas, it
was natural that she should, and ought to expect, that the
two powers would answer her conduct with a sincere
friendship. That at the news of the first differences
arisen between the two kingdoms, there were conferences
held with their Ambassadors, in which it was agreed upon
an equal footing; that the rules of the sea should not be
violated, and that they should be, on the contrary, exactly
observed and respected. That in consequence of this
agreement, the Porte had not neglected anything to fulfil
of fortresses and castles in the empire, to protect the ships
of war and merchant-men against every attack, and not to
suffer that any hostilities should be commenced in the
ports of the Grand Seignior, and under the cannon and in
sight of his fortresses.</p>

<p>"But in spite of all these measures, these powers had
not taken care to observe them, which was the cause that
no nation could now navigate freely and safely; that even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[476]</a></span>
to this time, the Porte had not received the least answer
on the subject of a regulation of neutrality, which had been
formed upon the footing of that which had been established
during former wars between Christian powers, and of
which communication had been made to the said Ambassadors,
with a view to put a stop to the intolerable irregularities
which had taken place in his seas, and to the end
to prevent in consequence continual complaints and representations.
That the Porte was informed foreign privateers
held his ports blocked up, and forced the ships
which entered into them or went out, without even excepting
the Turkish vessels, to submit to their unjust visits and
searches.</p>

<p>"That such a conduct, being contrary to the honor of
the empire, the Porte ought to determine, as soon as possible,
and communicate to the belligerent powers a good
regulation, to the end, to procure by that means repose, to
his subjects, whom Providence had confided to his care,
and to this end it was necessary, that the Ambassadors of
these two powers should be advertised to request their
Courts, in the first place, to send, as soon as possible, to
the captains and officers of ships armed for war, or privateers,
precise orders, and as some time must pass before
they can receive such orders, the Porte hopes that the
gentlemen, the Ambassadors, will be so good in the meantime,
as to order the captains and officers to suspend their
operations, and abstain from all acts of hostility.</p>

<p>"And as, in consequence of the ancient regulations,
every time that any vessels of war or armed ships come
into the seas of the Grand Seignior, the foreign Ministers
were held to give notice to the Porte of the object of their
expedition or voyage, of their destination, and of the time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[477]</a></span>
they were to stay, it could not but be regarded as unreasonable,
and entirely contrary to the reciprocal friendship,
if these formalities should not be observed, the Porte, considering
it as one of its principal duties, to employ all possible
means to procure the tranquillity of its merchants, to
protect their possessions against all force and injustice, as
also to grant its protection to the subjects of the belligerent
powers, and those of other powers who are equally
good friends of this empire."</p>

<p>The Porte finishes, by giving notice to the Ambassadors,
that the Capitan Pacha was ordered to oppose himself in a
friendly manner to the enterprises of those, who should
pursue the ancient proceedings, and to protect the merchants
and the ships of all nations, who carry on commerce
in the countries of this empire, whose sovereigns live in
friendship with the Porte.</p>

<p>A third is a letter from Petersburg, 7th of March. "The
rencounter which the Dutch convoy, on going out of the
Texel the later end of December, under the command of
Admiral Byland, had with the English squadron under
Commodore Fielding, as well as the violent and hostile
manner in which they made prize of this convoy, have occasioned
here the greatest astonishment, and it is very much
desired to know the consequences of this measure, which
is generally considered as very offensive to the Republic of
the United Provinces, and derogatory both to the treaties
subsisting between the two nations, to the law of nations,
and to the respect which ought to take place between two
free and independent powers."</p>

<p>But that which is thought more extraordinary still, is,
that the Court of London should have ordered a step so
violent and insulting at a time when, having to maintain a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[478]</a></span>
war so dangerous as that against France, Spain, and the
United States of America, her situation must appear not
less anxious than dangerous, which this Court itself seems
to acknowledge, by representing as she has done, that not
finding herself in a condition to oppose the dangerous designs
of the House of Bourbon, which, if you believe her,
threaten the safety of all Europe, she believed herself consequently
to have cause to demand succors here, as well
as from the Republic of the United Provinces. However
this may be, it is nevertheless notorious, that the solicitations
of England have produced no effect here, which has
given no small satisfaction to those, who consider in their
proper point of light the designs and the conduct of this
power, since the commencement of this war against the
liberty of commerce and the navigation of free and independent
powers, by means of which people in general
seem so much the more pleased with the present resolution
taken by her Majesty the Empress of all the Russias, relative
to the said solicitation, as well as with the system of
neutrality, which she has adopted, because without this
wise measure there is no doubt but Great Britain would
have pushed much further the irregularity of her proceedings.</p>

<p>The English, who are here, exert themselves as much
as they can to justify and even to praise this proceeding of
their nation towards the said convoy, but in vain have they
attempted to induce the public to adopt this error, by advancing
boldly, that the Court of Russia approves the violence,
which they have exercised in this rencounter. No
man believes them, since in fact it is impossible that the
Empress can approve an action so diametrically opposite
to the tenor of treaties, to the law of nations, as well as to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[479]</a></span>
the dignity of a sovereign and independent power, the injustice
of which is so notorious, that if it had been committed
with similar circumstances upon the Russian flag,
the Princess herself would have been the first to have
condemned it. Thus the reports, which the English propagate
here, of the approbation given to these proceedings,
imply so much the more of a manifest contradiction to the
sentiments and manner of thinking of the Empress and her
Ministers, that it is well known, that from the beginning of
the present troubles, the Court of Russia has made representations
and complaints against that of London, for the
violent and arbitrary manner of acting, which this last has
indulged herself in, against the navigation and commerce
of neutral powers, from whence it has resulted, that other
nations, in imitation of this proceeding, have embarrassed
business more and more, until there exists no safety
for any, which causes the greatest embarrassment to merchants
and the freighters of ships.</p>

<p>I ought to add to this letter, that the English emissaries,
who propagate false news everywhere and about everything,
having circulated a report, that the Porte was discontented
with the peace made with Russia, the Grand
Seignior thought it necessary to order the interpreter of the
Court to declare to all foreign Ministers, that the Sultan
and all his Ministers had every reason to be very well satisfied
with the accommodation with the Empress of Russia,
and that he was determined to maintain religiously all
the articles contained in that treaty. All these things tend
to show, that the state of Europe continues the same, and
that England, instead of getting an ally, is likely to have
a combination of all maritime powers to bring her to reason.</p>

<p>
I have the honor to be, &amp;c.</p>

<h3>TO WILLIAM CARMICHAEL, SECRETARY OF THE AMERICAN
EMBASSY AT MADRID.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">
Paris, April 8th, 1780.
</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,
</p>

<p>I have this moment the honor of your letter from Madrid
of the 29th of February, as I suppose, although the
month is not mentioned. I thank you, Sir, for commencing
a correspondence, which I have for some time wished
to begin. I wrote to Mr Jay at Madrid, on the 22d of
February, and wish to know if he has received the letter.
It is certainly proper, that those who are intrusted abroad
should maintain a correspondence and cultivate a good understanding
with each other, because, although their departments
are in some respects separate, yet in others they
are intimately connected. From all that I heard in Spain,
I expected, that you would meet with an agreeable reception
at Madrid; and I am much pleased to learn from
you, that I was not mistaken.</p>

<p>I have sometimes wondered at the slowness of Spain
in making a treaty with us; but, when I reflected upon a
certain secret article, my surprise ceased. We are already
bound in a treaty to her, but she is not bound to us.
It would be ungenerous in her, however, to hold us long in
this situation. The treaty, notwithstanding all that has
been justly said of the advantages to us, is not less advantageous
to our allies. The single article, that binds us to
exclude all armed vessels of the enemies, in all future wars,
from our ports, is worth more millions to them than this
war will cost; nay, it will be a severer loss to Great Britain,
than all that she has spent in it. Whether Great
Britain has considered this or not I do not know; but she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[481]</a></span>
will some time or other discover it, and feel the inconvenience
of it.</p>

<p>You ask for news from America. A vessel from Baltimore
is arrived at Bordeaux, but not a single letter to Dr
Franklin or me. She brings two or three Baltimore
newspapers, one as late as the 15th of February. There
has been a hard winter, deep snows, uncommon frosts,
frozen over from Connecticut to Long Island, and from
New Jersey to Staten Island. Lord Sterling went over to
Staten Island with a party on the ice, burnt a few vessels
and a guard house, took a few prisoners, and brought off
a few deserters. Some New Jersey people went over at
the same time, and plundered without mercy. Finding
the communication open with New York, which had been
supposed to be obstructed by the ice, he returned. An
article from a Fishkill paper says, that Clinton and Cornwallis
sailed the 26th of December, with seven thousand
men, for the West Indies, but that the storm, which happened
soon after their departure, was supposed to have
done him mischief. A ship, brig, and schooner were lost
in the storm on Cape Cod, unknown who or whence, all
perished. Congress had recommended to all the States
to regulate prices at twenty for one, which, by the speculations
in the papers, was not well liked. Governor Johnson
is a delegate for Maryland, General Ward for Massachusetts,
in the room of Mr Dana, (who desires me to return
you his compliments and respects.) The other delegates
as last year. This is all the news I can recollect,
having seen the papers only a few minutes in a large
company.</p>

<p>The general state of affairs appears very well. I see
no probability of England's obtaining an ally; on the contrary,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[482]</a></span>
there are many symptoms of an approaching combination
of the maritime powers, to protect neutral ships
from searches and insults. Ireland is in the full career of
independence. England seems determined to force Holland
into a war against her, that she may have an opportunity
to plunder her.</p>

<p>The correspondences and associations in England distress
the Ministry very much; and, if the war continues
and they should not be very successful, it seems likely, that
they would save us the trouble of despatching them. I
wish, however, that France and Spain were more convinced
of the advantages they have in America and the
West Indies. The more ships they send into those seas, the
more they will force England to send there; and the more
she sends there, the weaker she is in Europe, and the less
she is dreaded and respected. Holland, Ireland, the opposition
in England, and the other maritime powers all feel
a confidence rising in proportion to the diminution of the
British naval force in Europe, besides the innumerable advantages
the French and Spaniards have, in supporting
the war in the American seas over the English, which they
have not in Europe; but I am apprehensive of being
tedious. My compliments to Mr Jay and his family.</p>

<p>I am, with much respect, your most obedient and humble
servant,</p>

<p>Making a total number of fortysix vessels.</p>

<h3>TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">
Paris, April 10th, 1780.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,
</p>

<p>There are several miscellaneous articles of intelligence,
which ought to be mentioned to Congress.</p>

<p>One from Copenhagen, of the 25th of March. "The
Count de Lucchese, Minister of the King of the Two Sicilies,
and charged at the same time with the affairs of the
Court of Madrid, has received orders to declare to ours,
that the King of Spain had it in contemplation to make
arrangements relative to merchant ships of neutral powers,
and with which we should have cause to be very well
pleased. However this may be, we have not any news
that the Danish ships detained, to the number of twenty, at
Cadiz and Malaga, have been as yet released, which is a
great damage to those who are interested in those vessels.</p>

<p>"There is arrived in this city a courier coming from St
Petersburg, who has also passed through Stockholm, who
after having delivered his despatches to the Envoy Extraordinary
of her Majesty, the Empress of all the Russias, at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[485]</a></span>
this Court, immediately continued his journey for Hamburg."</p>

<p>Another is from Madrid, the 13th of March. "It is said
that our Court will soon publish a new regulation relative to
the Dutch navigation. In the meantime, they have released
two ships of this nation, viz. the Griffin and the Zandam,
which were detained at Algeziras.</p>

<p>"The register ships destined for the Havana and Vera
Cruz, which are ready at Cadiz, are to sail immediately;
these ships will be convoyed by twelve ships of the line
and two frigates, as far as the Canary Islands. It is assured,
that there will be embarked on board of this fleet,
twelve thousand men, who are to be transported to America
under the command of Don Victa de Nava, Lieutenant
General. The last letters from the Havana import,
that there were in that port fourteen ships of the line, as
well as four thousand men ready to embark for an expedition,
the object of which is yet unknown. Two of our
cruisers have entered Barcelona with five very rich prizes,
among which, one had on board eighteen thousand guineas,
destined for Mahon."</p>

<p>Another from Paris. "Letters from Malta of the 11th
of February inform, that the King's frigate, the Syracuse,
commanded by M. Clavel, off Candia, has taken the English
cutter, the Buck, of twentyfour guns, twelve swivels,
and two hundred and three men, commanded by Captain
George Flagg, and that the bad condition to which the
engagement had reduced her, had induced him to sink
her."</p>

<p>Another from Francfort, of the 1st of April. "They
write from Hesse, that they continued to raise many recruits,
and that there were at Ziagenham six hundred and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[486]</a></span>
eight volunteers, who were to set off in a little time with
eleven hundred and twenty men for America."</p>

<p>Another from Amsterdam, of the 6th of March. "We
learn from Dort, that they expected there the English vessels
destined to transport the German troops for the service
of England, which were still at Nimeguen; and they
write from the Hague, that General Faucet had arrived
there a few days since."</p>

<p>Another from London, of the 31st of March. "The
despatches, which the Court has last received from Sir Joseph
Yorke, excite the particular attention of the Ministry.
Although the contents of them have not yet been made
public, it is said, nevertheless, that in consequence of the
memorial, presented on the 21st to the States-General by
the British Minister, their High Mightinesses have taken
the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pre-avis</i>, relative to the succors demanded by Great
Britain, which, although conceived in very moderate
terms, contains, nevertheless, a refusal to furnish the succors
demanded. The Republic, as it is pretended, founding
its inability to comply with this demand principally
upon the non-existence of the case of invasion of the British
States, as a case, which alone could lay them under
obligation to accede to the requisition of the King of England,
the Count de Welderen, Envoy Extraordinary of
the States-General, has been on the 29th in conference with
Lord Stormont, and communicated to him the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pre-avis</i>
of their High Mightinesses, relative to the requisition
of his Britannic Majesty, upon the subject of which the
States-General will soon take a formal resolution. It is
reported also, that his Excellency has likewise imparted to
our Ministry the sentence of a court martial, which has
adjudged, that Count Byland was not the aggressor in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[487]</a></span>
affair of the seizure of the Dutch ships by Commodore
Fielding. However, it is asserted, that the Court of St
James has declared afresh, 'That if the States-General
refuse to furnish to England the succors demanded in
virtue of the treaties, she will give orders to search, without
distinction, all Dutch ships under convoy and without convoy,
and that all the merchandises and effects destined for
the French and Spaniards, which shall be found loaded
on board of these vessels, shall be seized and confiscated;
adding, that it is neither just nor reasonable, that the Republic
should be excused, on her part, from the observation
of the treaties, while England should be held on hers
to fulfil the conditions, and that thus, in consequence of her
former declaration, the Republic should be no more considered
but on the footing of other neutral powers.'</p>

<p>"They say, moreover, that the reasons alleged by their
High Mightinesses in justification of their refusal to acquiesce
in the demand of England, are of a nature to convince
our Ministry, that such an acquiescence would produce
consequences equally hurtful to the respective interests of
the two powers in the present conjuncture.</p>

<p>"We are assured, that each man of the crews of the
squadron of Commodore Fielding, will receive more than
nine pounds sterling, for his share of the proceeds of
the captures made of the Dutch convoy, and that there
will be two hundred pounds sterling paid to the King's
ships at Spithead, for their part of the prizes which they
have made.</p>

<p>"The Court has received, within a few days, a great
number of despatches from its Ministers at foreign Courts,
the contents of which have given occasion to several cabinet
councils. Those of Sir Joseph Yorke have excited
a particular attention.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[488]</a></span>"The officers of all the vessels of war destined for sea,
have received orders to repair on board as soon as possible,
and be ready to sail on the first notice. The officers of the
regiments of regular troops, and of the militia, must also
join their respective corps without delay, that they may be
ready to march by the middle of April. The forces will
encamp nearly in the same place as last year; and there
will be some detached corps ready to join the different
camps according to circumstances."</p>

<p>I have the honor to be, with the greatest respect and
esteem, &amp;c.</p>

<h3>TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">
Paris, April 10th, 1780.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,
</p>

<p>The <cite>Memoire</cite> of the Prince Gallitzen, Envoy Extraordinary
from the Empress of all the Russias to the States-General,
presented the third of this month, is of too much
importance to the United States of America, and their
allies, to be omitted to be sent to Congress. It is of the
following tenor.</p>

<blockquote><p>
"High and Mighty Lords,
</p>

<p>"The undersigned, Envoy Extraordinary of her Majesty,
the Empress of all the Russias, has the honor to
communicate a copy of the declaration, which the Empress,
his Sovereign, has made to the powers actually at
war. Your High Mightinesses may regard this communication,
as a particular mark of the attention of the Empress
to the Republic, equally interested in the reasons which
have given birth to this declaration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[489]</a></span>"He has, moreover, orders to declare, in the name of
her Imperial Majesty, that how much soever she may
desire, on the one hand, to maintain during the present
war the strictest neutrality, she will, nevertheless maintain,
by means the most efficacious, the honor of the Russian
flag, and the safety of her commerce, and the navigation of
her subjects, and will not suffer that any injury should be
done to it by any of the belligerent powers. That to
avoid, on this occasion, all misunderstanding or false interpretation,
she has thought it her duty to specify in her
declaration the terms of a free commerce, and of that
which is called contraband; that if the definition is founded
upon notions the most simple, the most clear, and the
most determinate by the law of nature, that of the latter is
taken by her literally from the treaty of commerce of
Russia with Great Britain; that by this she proves incontestably
her good faith, and her impartiality towards both
parties; that she thinks, consequently, that she ought to
expect, that the other commercial powers will be earnest to
accede to her manner of thinking relative to the neutrality.</p>

<p>"In pursuance of these two views, her Majesty has
charged the subscriber to invite your High Mightinesses
to make a common cause with her; insomuch, that this
union may serve to protect commerce and navigation, observing
at the same time the most exact neutrality, and to
communicate to you the measures which she has taken in
consequence. Similar invitations have been already made
to the Courts of Copenhagen, Stockholm, and Lisbon, to
the end, that by the common cares of all neutral maritime
powers, a neutral system, founded on justice, and which,
by its real utility, may serve as a rule for future ages, may
be established and made legal in favor of the commercial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[490]</a></span>
navigation of neutral nations. The subscriber makes no
doubt, that your High Mightinesses will take into consideration
the invitation of her Imperial Majesty, and concur in
making, without delay, a declaration to the belligerent
powers, founded upon the same principles with those of
the Empress, his sovereign, by explaining your sentiments
at the same time upon the subject of the protection of your
commerce, of your navigation, and of the nature of contraband
goods, conformably to the terms of your particular
treaties with other nations. Moreover, the subscriber has
the honor to assure your High Mightinesses, that if, for
establishing solidly a system, equally glorious and advantageous
to the prosperity of navigation in general, you will
commence a negotiation with the neutral powers abovementioned,
to the end to establish a particular convention
upon this subject, the Empress, his sovereign, will be ready
to engage in it.</p>

<p>"Your High Mightinesses will readily perceive the necessity
of coming to a resolution upon subjects equally important
and advantageous to humanity in general.</p>

<p>"The subscriber requests the favor, that your High
Mightinesses would furnish him with a speedy answer.</p>

<p class="signature">
GALLITZEN."

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<h3>DECLARATION</h3>

<blockquote><p><em>Of her Majesty, the Empress of Russia, made to the Courts
of Versailles, Madrid, and London, mentioned in the
foregoing Memorial.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>"The Empress of all the Russias has manifested so visibly
the sentiments of justice, equity, and moderation, which
animate her, and has given, during the whole course of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[491]</a></span>
war maintained against the Ottoman Porte, such convincing
proofs of her attention to the rights of neutrality, and the
freedom of commerce in general, that, in this respect, she
may appeal to the testimony of all Europe. This conduct,
as well as the scrupulous exactness with which she has
observed the rules of neutrality during the Course of this
war, has given her room to hope, that her subjects would
peaceably enjoy the fruits of their industry, and the advantages,
which belong to all neutral nations. Experience
has, however, taught her the contrary, since neither these
considerations, nor the regard due to what the law of nations
in general prescribes, have been able to hinder the subjects
of her Majesty from being oftentimes troubled in their navigation,
or interrupted or retarded in their commerce, by
the subjects of the belligerent powers. These interruptions
having come upon business in general, and that of Russia
in particular, are of a nature to awaken the attention of all
the neutral nations, and oblige her Majesty, the Empress,
to seek to deliver herself from them by all means suitable
to her dignity and the well being of her subjects.</p>

<p>"But before she shall put them in execution, being filled
with a sincere desire to prevent all subsequent acts of violence,
she has thought that it was consistent with her equity
to lay open to all Europe the principles, which will govern
her, and which are indispensable to prevent all misunderstanding,
as well as all which might give occasion to it.
To this she has determined herself with so much the more
confidence, as these principles are drawn from the primitive
law of nations, and adopted by all nations, which the
belligerent powers themselves cannot enervate, at least not
without violating the laws of neutrality, and contemning the
fundamental rules which they themselves have adopted, in
divers treaties and alliances now existing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[492]</a></span>"<span class="smcap">Article i.</span> That all neutral vessels ought to navigate
freely from one port to another, as well as upon the coasts
of the powers now at war.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Article ii.</span> That the effects belonging to the subjects
of the belligerent powers shall be free in neutral ships,
excepting always contraband goods.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Article iii.</span> That her Imperial Majesty, in consequence
of the limits above fixed, will adhere strictly to that
which is stipulated by the tenth and eleventh articles of her
treaty of commerce with Great Britain, concerning the
manner in which she ought to conduct towards all the belligerent
powers.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Article iv.</span> That as to what concerns a port blocked
up, we ought not in truth to consider as such any but
those, which are found so well shut up by a fixed and sufficient
number of vessels belonging to the power which attacks
it, that one cannot attempt to enter into such port
without evident danger.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Article v.</span> That these principles above laid down
ought to serve as a rule in all proceedings, whenever there
is a question concerning the legality of prizes.</p>

<p>"From these considerations, her Imperial Majesty makes
no difficulty to declare, that wishing to insure the execution
of that, which is herein before declared, to maintain at
the same time the honor of her flag, as well as the safety
of the commerce of her States, and also to protect the
navigation of her subjects against all those whom it may
concern, she has given orders that a considerable portion
of her maritime forces shall be put to sea, with no other
intention than to insure the observation of the most exact
and the most strict neutrality, which her Majesty proposes
to keep as long as she shall not see herself absolutely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[493]</a></span>
forced to depart from that system of moderation and of
perfect neutrality, which she has adopted; in such sort,
that it will not be but in the last extremity, that her fleet
will exercise her final orders to go wherever the necessity
and the circumstances may require.</p>

<p>"It is then by assuring the belligerent powers in the
most solemn manner, and with all that rectitude and sincerity,
which form the distinguishing character of her Imperial
Majesty, that she declares to them that she proposes
to herself no other thing, than to convince them of the sentiments
of equity with which she is animated, as well as of
the tendency of her salutary views towards the well being
of all nations in general, and particularly of those now at
war, and that consequently her Imperial Majesty will provide
her Admiralty as well as her Generals with instructions
relative to this system, extracted from the code of
nations, and which they have so often taken for rules in
their treaties."</p>

<p>In all, twentyfive counties.</p>

<p>The first meeting of the delegates was March the 11th,
1780. The cities and towns, which have agreed upon
similar petitions, are London, Westminster, York, Bristol,
Cambridge, Nottingham, Newcastle, Reading, and Bridgewater.</p>

<p>The counties, which have not yet agreed upon petitions,
are Westmoreland, Durham, Lancaster, Salop, Stafford,
Lincoln, Leicester, Warwick, Oxford, Worcester, Cornwall,
and Rutland. Hants agreed on a petition, but appointed
no committee, and Northampton agreed to instruct
their members on the points of the petition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[495]</a></span>This account takes no notice of the twelve Welsh counties;
these, however, are small.</p>

<p>The counties, which have already petitioned, it seems,
therefore, are a vast majority of the kingdom in numbers
as well as property and understanding; and the meeting of
their committees may be reasonably considered as a more
equitable and adequate representation of the people of
England, than the House of Commons.</p>

<p>Amidst all the addresses, instructions, petitions, associations,
and resolutions, I never found one that dared to expose
the true cause of their miseries, and to propose a
remedy, until the association of the county of York appeared,
which was agreed to by the committee of sixtyone,
to be recommended to the general meeting of the county
of York, held the 28th of March, 1780.</p>

<p>They declare their unanimous assent,</p>

<p>1st. To the economical reform requested by the petitions
of the people.</p>

<p>2dly. To the proposition for obtaining a more equal
representation of the people in Parliament, by the addition of
at least one hundred Knights, to be chosen in a due proportion
by the several counties of Great Britain.</p>

<p>3dly. To the proposition for the members of the House
of Commons to be elected, to serve in Parliament for a
term not exceeding three years.</p>

<p>But the most important resolution of all was also unanimous,
"That it is the opinion of this meeting, that the
prosecution of an offensive war in America is most evidently
a measure, which, by employing our great and
enormously expensive military operations against the inhabitants
of that country, prevents this from exerting its
united, vigorous, and firm efforts against the powers of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[496]</a></span>
France and Spain, and has no other effect upon America,
than to continue, and thereby to increase the enmity, which
has so long and so fatally subsisted between the arms of
both, can be productive of no good whatever, but by preventing
conciliation, threatens the accomplishment of the
ruin of the British Empire."</p>

<p>This meeting, which is said to have been the largest
ever known, and perfectly unanimous, gave power to the
committee of association to call the county together when
they should judge proper.</p>

<p>After all, even this committee does not appear to see
the true interest of the country, the necessity of peace.
Peace alone can save them. They are for leaving America,
which is a great thing; but it does not appear but that
they are still for continuing the war with our allies.</p>

<p>An article of the 4th of April says, that commotions are
reported to have arisen in the County of York, many of
the inhabitants of which have peremptorily refused to pay
the taxes.</p>

<p>Congress will observe by the paragraphs in the Morning
Post of April the 1st, that they seem to be in England
totally ignorant of the designs of the Empress of Russia,
and of the other neutral powers.</p>

<p>The paper of April the 3d contains Major General
Campbell's and Lieutenant Colonel Dickson's account of
the surrender of the port of Baton Rouge, &amp;c. with about
five hundred regular troops prisoners of war, to Don Bernado
de Galvez, the 21st of September.</p>

<h3>TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">
Paris, April 14th, 1780.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,
</p>

<p>Everything which tends to show the probability of a general
association of the maritime powers, against the violences
at sea, which the English have practised, and
which other nations, after their example, have begun, and
which tends to prove the justice, the wisdom, and the humanity
of such an association, is worthy of observation.
For my own part, I think, that the abolition of the whole
doctrine of contraband would be for the peace and happiness
of mankind; and I doubt not, as human reason advances,
and men come to be more sensible of the benefits
of peace, and less enthusiastic for the savage glories of
war, all neutral nations will be allowed, by universal consent,
to carry what goods they please in their own ships,
provided they are not bound to places actually invested by
an enemy.</p>

<p><em>Constantinople, March the 3d.</em> "The Porte having
received the disagreeable news, that three xebecs from
Malta had seized upon a large Turkish ship with a rich
cargo of coffee, rice, hemp, and other productions, this
advice has accelerated the departure of two men-of-war
and four gallies, which will go before the fleet of the Grand
Admiral, to cruise in the Archipelago, and protect the navigation
of the European nations against the vexations of
the French and English."</p>

<p><em>Copenhagen, March the 28th.</em> "Captain Zagel, the
courier of her Majesty, the Empress of all the Russias, is
returned to Petersburgh, accompanied by Captain Socolousky,
Secretary of the Russian Consul in the Sound.
They are very busy here in equipping the vessels of war,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[498]</a></span>
the Wagrie, of sixtyfour guns, the Infodstretten, of sixtyfour,
and the frigate Combord, of thirtyfour."</p>

<p><em>London, April the 4th.</em> "There are lately arrived here
interesting despatches to government from Sir Joseph
Yorke, which contain some further explanations of the dispositions
of the Republic, in consequence of the last Memorial
presented to their High Mightinesses by that Minister,
and the resolution to protect the commerce of their
subjects. However this may be, there are actually in
the ports of this kingdom fifty Dutch vessels seized by our
ships of war, because they were found loaded with naval
stores for our enemies; and, already the most of their
cargoes have been adjudged good prizes. These articles
being considered as contraband, and their transportation to
an enemy contrary to treaties subsisting between the Republic
and England."</p>

<p><em>Hague, April the 9th.</em> "We learn, that the States of the
Province of Overyssell have sent to the Assembly of their
High Mightinesses their instructions, relative to the two Memorials
presented by Sir Joseph Yorke, the 28th of July, and
the 26th of November, of the last year, the first purporting
a demand of succors stipulated by the treaty of 1678, and
the second demanding an immediate and categorical answer.
The contents of the instructions are, 'That their Noble
Mightinesses, after having maturely reflected upon all which
concerns the matter in question, especially upon the treaties
existing between the kingdom and the Republics, as well
as the obligations, which the two nations had mutually laid
themselves under, and also in particular, upon the present
situation in which this republic now stands in several points
respecting her own preservation, the maintenance of her
rights and possessions, and respecting the powers actually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[499]</a></span>
at war, judge, that the two Memorials presented by Sir
Joseph Yorke may and ought to be answered in the following
manner. That all the principles alleged, and the
circumstances at this time existing, oblige their High
Mightinesses more than ever to watch carefully their own
preservation and defence, to use every effort to ward off
all further dangerous consequences, and to this end, to
request his Majesty not to take it in ill part, if in the critical
situation of affairs, in which the least diminution of
their forces might be dangerous, their High Mightinesses
think themselves lawfully authorised to refuse the succors
demanded by his Majesty, although these succors, considering
certain engagements, the pretended application of
which it would be useless at this time to search into, may
be judged indispensable by his Majesty, in the firm
confidence, that, in the circumstances in which their High
Mightinesses find themselves, his Majesty, not disapproving,
of their conduct, will desist, not only from demanding their
assistance, but on the contrary, as a proof of the affection
of which his Majesty had so often given them assurances,
will permit them invariably to pursue that neutrality, which
from the beginning of the present troubles they have
adopted.'</p>

<p>"It is asserted, that on the Memorial presented by the
Prince Gallitzen, Envoy Extraordinary of the Empress of
Russia, their High Mightinesses have provisionally concluded,
'That having taken the said Memorial into consideration,
the deputies of the respective Provinces have sent
copies of it, as well as of the papers annexed to it, to be
communicated to their Assemblies, praying them to procure,
as soon as possible, the resolutions of the States,
their constituents.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[500]</a></span>"In the meantime, since the said Memorial has been
made public, it is given out, that the convention between
the Courts of Petersburgh, Stockholm, and Copenhagen,
will in a little time be confirmed, and that
Denmark will procure, on certain conditions, five or six
thousand seamen for this Republic.</p>

<p>"We learn that the answer of his Britannic Majesty to
the representations which the Count de Walderen, Minister
of the States-General at the Court of London, has
been charged by their High Mightinesses to make to the
British Government, relative to a prolongation of the term
of three weeks, prescribed in the last Memorial of Sir Joseph
Yorke, for giving him a definitive answer, &amp;c. arrived
the 31st of last month, and is found to be in the negative,
the King insisting on an answer by the time fixed, which
will expire next Tuesday.</p>

<p>"They give out, that the cities of Dantzic, Lubec, Bremen,
Hamburgh, &amp;c. will adopt, as well as most of the
northern powers, the party of neutrality, and that, if England
persists in the practice of visiting, stopping, and
searching neutral vessels, Denmark is resolved to exclude
English vessels from the Sound."</p>

<p>To judge of things the most impartially, no man can
doubt, that proceedings so violent, and so contrary to the
natural rights of nations, will make the neutral powers <em>feel</em>
how much it imports them to set bounds to the intolerable
excesses, to which their vessels, sailing under the faith
of treaties, are daily exposed by the ships of one party in
the present war.</p>

<p>
I have the honor to be, &amp;c.</p>

<h3>TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p class="letter_head">
Paris, April 15th, 1780.</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,
</p>

<p>There is an article from Hamburgh which deserves attention;
it is this.</p>

<p>"The neutrality of the powers of the north is decided.
They have profited of the divisions, which have arisen
between England and North America, by selling to the
former, timber, cordage, hemp, and tar, which she formerly
drew from her Colonies. The occasions, which the
enemies of Great Britain have also had for these articles,
have established a competition, which has procured great
advantages to the commerce of the north. They have
everywhere taken measures to protect it."</p>

<p>In vain has England sought assistance from that quarter;
her conduct has irrevocably deprived her of it.</p>

<p><em>Leghorn, 22d of March.</em> "We learn from Naples, that
the King has purchased of the Order of Malta two vessels,
to increase the marine of that kingdom. His Majesty is
attentively engaged in the care of forming officers for this
department. The young gentry, whom he has sent to
serve on board of the squadrons of the belligerent powers,
have all of them distinguished themselves; and those who
remain at Naples, under the direction of the Chevalier
Aston, have discovered equal zeal, intelligence, and good
will, for the service of the marine."</p>

<p><em>Madrid, 25th of March.</em> "Our squadrons, they write
from Cadiz the 16th of this month, will put to sea without
delay. Transport ships are taken up on freight with great
activity, and all the troops are arrived. The following is
an exact state of the armament.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[502]</a></span>"The complete regiments of the King, Guadalajara,
Arragon, Soria, and the second regiment of Catalonia; in
all ten battalions, making six thousand and six hundred
men.</p>

<p>"The squadron of D. Solano; the St Louis, of eighty
guns, the St Augustine, the Orient, the Gaillard, the Arrogant,
all of seventy guns, and the Rule of sixty guns.</p>

<p>"The squadron of D. Tomaseo; the St Nicholas, of
eighty guns, the Eugene, the Damase, the St Janizer, the
St Francis, the Assisse, and the Warrior, all of seventy
guns.</p>

<p>"The first squadron takes in provisions for five months,
and the second for four months and a half. They fill up
the regiments, which are destined for the expedition, with
soldiers from the regiment of Hibernia.</p>

<p>"The beautiful wools of Segovia have not been always
employed within the kingdom, because the love of labor
has not been predominant; but since the establishment
of the royal patriotic society, industry has recovered its
activity. D. Laurent Ortiz de Paz has established spinneries
of wool in that city, and in St Ildephonso, and
other places. His Majesty has assigned rewards for men
and women, who shall distinguish themselves in this kind
of labor. This measure cannot fail to establish the royal
manufacture of fine cloth, which the Marquis of Ense√±ada
had already erected at Segovia, and which had fallen into
decay with the favor of that Minister."</p>

<p>There are in some of the papers hints of a plan of pacification,
which is said to come from the Rockingham party.
The substance of it is as follows.</p>

<p>"Let us open our eyes! The hope of subjecting America
is a chimera. Nothing but clemency can ever open a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[503]</a></span>
way for a reconciliation with its inhabitants. To show that
we wish it sincerely let us give up Nova Scotia, that dry,
uninhabitable, and languishing colony, which produces
nothing. Let us also permit the Canadians to institute a
form of government, which may be agreeable to themselves,
and let the independence of North America become the
object of our support. Sooner or later it will be unavoidable,
that America should separate herself from us, and I
should be very glad that a permanent system of alliance
should take place between them and their mother country,
before our ancient colonies shall be united to France, by
ties too strict to be relaxed. I am persuaded, that neither
Nova Scotia nor Canada will remain long under the government
of England; and it is to be feared, that in contending
for them we shall still further embroil affairs. Nova Scotia
is not worth the trouble of keeping it, and it will require
continual succors. Canada will occasion us more expense
than it will bring us in profit, and will never become flourishing
under an European government; at least unless the
whole country should be recovered. We deceive ourselves
if we imagine, that by emancipating the Americans we
shall lose our American islands. We hold these by the
strongest of all ties, which is, that of their own interest.
North America will not seek to make conquests so long as
it shall be divided into distinct States, and under a republican
form of government; and it is probable, that several
centuries will pass away before she will change the form of
her administrations. Commerce will return into England,
and into our islands, without any other motive than that
which actuates all the commercial nations of the earth. If
we were now disembarrassed of the objects of dispute,
concerning which Spain discovers so many pretensions, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[504]</a></span>
if we could content ourselves with a superiority at sea, all
that would result from it would be, that our trade to the
Levant would increase, we should become more respectable,
and we should see ourselves more in a condition to
maintain our quarrels, and protect our rich possessions,
without hazarding a bankruptcy by expenses, which we
cannot sustain. Our maritime power will always be sufficient
to protect our islands. Our naval forces will never
want anything so long as we shall have divers markets,
where our vessels may go. The northern powers of
Europe, and the northern States of America, will be competitors
to serve us, so long as we preserve the superiority
upon the sea, and while, by means of our manufacturers,
we can pay for them, or make an advantageous exchange,
with the one and the other. We have as good a right to
things, which we can purchase in divers foreign markets, as
if the things were the productions of our own establishments.</p>

<p>"Are France and Spain in want of warlike stores? Are
they not as well supplied with them as we are? And do
they not make Sweden rather incline to their side, by means
of their commerce with that country for these articles?
Is it probable that they can ever shut up from us the ports
of America, of Russia, of Denmark, and of Sweden, while
it is the interest of these States to furnish us? It is necessary,
then, to resolve to demand peace by the means which
offer themselves, and which are not only able to obtain it,
but may still be preserved, and in which there is no appearance
that we shall be disturbed, if, at least, at all times we
preserve our marine upon a respectable footing; and, if
we do not, we ever subject ourselves to be restrained upon
the article of the number of ships, and in the places
where we shall employ them. In that case we shall not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[505]</a></span>
perceive that Gibraltar or Minorca is wanting to us. We
shall always be ready to meet our enemies in those parts
where our safety, security, and riches lie, and which nature
points out to us as our proper element. Surrounded on
all sides by the sea, there is one half of the nation whose
inhabitants understand navigation, from their infancy, and
they are disposed to become seamen because they are
almost educated with the sea. But whenever we shall
engage ourselves in the wars of the continent, we shall
never draw from them any solid advantages. Where are
the trophies so dearly purchased of King William and
Marlborough? And where is the benefit of the two last
wars? The balance of power will not remain long in our
hands, although we have engaged the annual produce of
an innumerable quantity of taxes.</p>

<p>"In America we have destroyed the balance, which held
our colonies in dependence. We ought not, then, to lose
the opportunity of binding the interests of the United
States with ours by some amicable convention, which will
assure us of their attachment, and deliver us from the cruel
necessity of continuing the war with our own children.
It is by this means we may preserve for a long time our
insular property, and enjoy still a superiority at sea."</p>

<p><em>Paris, April 11th 1780.</em> "The Ambassador of Russia
has notified, within a few days past, to our Court, that
it was the intention of his sovereign that the commerce of
the subjects of her empire should not be troubled, and that
under no pretence should their vessels be stopped by those
of the belligerent powers, and that she is arming to defend
her flag, and protect it from insults. This declaration was
to be made at the same time to the Courts of Madrid and
London. It is asserted, that it is the first fruit of a treaty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[506]</a></span>
of commerce, which Russia has concluded with us, and of
a confederation which she has entered into with the other
northern powers, and in which they wish to engage Holland
and Portugal. We are very inquisitive to learn how
this notification will be received by the Court of St James."</p>

<p>The English ministerial gazettes propagate a report,
that there was arrived in Europe a deputy of Congress to
offer peace to Great Britain. Those of the opposition
assert, that this deputy who is in fact arrived, will do nothing
but in concert with France, when it shall please England
to propose a negotiation of peace.</p>

<p>The following article is published in the English papers,
to excite the people against the opposition.</p>

<p>"If the Marquis of Rockingham should come again into
the administration, his first operation would most probably
be, to declare America independent. This would, nevertheless,
be a fatal resolution, which, instead of giving us
peace, would throw that event still farther off. A proof so
striking of our pusilanimity would raise still higher the
hopes and the pride of the House of Bourbon. France
would demand that we should restore to them Canada,
Cape Breton, and Nova Scotia, as well as the islands
which were taken from her the last war. Nothing less
would be necessary for Spain than the restitution of Gibraltar
and Jamaica. But it cannot but be supposed, that the
Marquis of Rockingham is too much attached to his head
to expose it to danger by so shameful a dismemberment
of our empire. He would then make us continue the war
with the disadvantage of not being able any longer to rein
in the Americans, who would assist everywhere their allies
by land and by sea. But every Englishman of good sense
sees to what disasters this plan of conduct would lead us.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[507]</a></span>
The ambition of this Marquis and of his party is not to
triumph over rebels, and the natural enemies of England;
it is to humble his King and ruin his country."</p>

<p class="letter_open">Sir,

<p>I have received the two letters, which your Excellency
did me the honor to write to me, on the 5th and on the
12th of this month.</p>

<p>I do not mean to give your Excellency the trouble of
answering these letters of mine, which contain extracts of
letters from abroad, or simply news. This would be giving
your Excellency too much trouble, and taking up too
much time. Indeed, I think it will very probably be often,
if not always unnecessary, because your Excellency's information
must be, beyond all comparison, earlier, more exact,
and more particular than mine; yet, as it is possible
that sometimes a circumstance of importance may escape
one channel of intelligence, and yet pass in another, I
thought it to be my duty sometimes to send your Excellency
an extract. In this view, I now have the honor to
send your Excellency another extract from a letter of the
6th of this month; but I pray your Excellency not to take
the trouble to answer it.</p>

<p class="letter_head">
Madrid, April 25th, 1781.

<p>
The letters herewith enclosed from Dr Franklin were left open

time for copies to be made of the information conveyed in and with it.

I perceive that Dr Franklin desires to retire; this circumstance calls
upon me to assure Congress, that I have reason to be perfectly satisfied
with his conduct towards me, and that I have received from him all the
aid and attention I could wish or expect. His character is very high
here, and I really believe, that the respectability he enjoys throughout
Europe has been of general use to our cause and country.

EXTRACT OF A LETTER FROM JOHN JAY.
</h3>
<p class="letter_head">
Madrid, April 21st, 1781.
</p>
<p>
By the letter from Dr Franklin, herewith enclosed, and which he
was so obliging as to leave open for my perusal, I find he has requested
permission to retire, on account of his age, infirmities, &amp;c. How far his
health may be impaired I know not. The letters I have received from
him bear no marks of age, and there is an acuteness and sententious
brevity in them, which do not indicate an understanding injured by
years. I have many reasons to think our country much indebted to
him, and I confess it would mortify my pride as an American, if his constituents
should be the only people to whom his character is known, and
that should deny to his merit and services the testimony given them by
other nations. Justice demands of me to assure you, that his reputation
and respectability are acknowledged, and have weight here, and
that I have received from him all that uniform attention and aid, which
were due to the importance of the affairs committed to me.
</p><p>
The affectionate mention he makes of his only descendant, on whom
the support of his name and family will devolve, is extremely amiable,
and flows in a delicate manner from that virtuous sensibility, by which
nature kindly extends the benefits of parental affection, to a period
beyond the limits of our lives. This is an affectionate subject, and minds
susceptible of the finer sensations are insensibly led at least to wish
that the feelings of an ancient patriot, going, in the evening of a long
life early devoted to the public, to enjoy repose in the bosom of philosophic
retirement, may be gratified by seeing some little sparks of the
affection of his country rest on the only support of his age and hope
of his family. Such are the effusions of my heart on this occasion,
and I pour them into yours, from a persuasion, that they will meet with
a hospitable reception from congenial emotions.

COLONEL JOHN LAURENS TO B. FRANKLIN.
</h3>

<p class="letter_head">
Leagues W. of Ortegal, June 9th, 1781.
</p>

<p class="letter_open">
Sir,
</p>
<p>
I snatch a moment to pay my last respects to your Excellency, and
to mention a matter, which has occurred to me since my being on board.
I have frequently reflected upon the mention, which your Excellency
has made of retiring from your present important station, and have
never varied the opinion, which I took the liberty of giving you once at
the Count de Vergennes', viz. that the best arrangement would be to
give your Excellency an active, intelligent Secretary of the Embassy,
who might relieve you from the drudgery of office; and that your
country should not be deprived of the advantages of your wisdom and
influence. The difficulty hitherto has been to find a person properly
qualified. The advantages, which your grandson derives from his
knowledge of the language, and manners of the people, and his having
been so long in your office, and with your Excellency, are very great.
The prejudices, which have been entertained against him, may be removed
by a personal introduction to Congress, especially if it is combined
with rendering a popular service. I take the liberty of proposing
to your Excellency, therefore, if you can spare Mr Franklin for the
purpose, to commit to his care the second remittance of money, and to
hasten his departure with that, and as much of the public supplies of
clothing, &amp;c. as may be ready to accompany it. I am persuaded, that
in public bodies, the want of a personal acquaintance is a great objection
to appointing a man to any important office.
</p><p>
The Engageante's boat demands my letter. I have written in the
greatest haste upon a subject, which I hope your Excellency will turn
to public utility.

Adams, he says the account of the Commissioners' expenses here given
is "exaggerated," and "put much too high," owing to his having been
but a short time in Paris, and not being accurately informed on the subject.
See this letter hereafter, dated February 14th, 1779, in the
present volume.

By a letter from Mr Arthur Lee, dated May 9th, 1778, containing a
transcript from the banker's books, it appears, that from December,
1776, to March, 1778, a period of fifteen months, Silas Deane received
on his private account, $20,926; Arthur Lee, $12,749; and Dr
Franklin, $12,214. <em>See</em> <cite>Arthur Lee's Correspondence</cite>, Vol. II. p. 159,
where the above sums are stated in livres, and they are here reduced to
dollars by the rule practised at that time, of allowing five livres and
eight sols to the dollar. The fractions are omitted in the reduction.
It must be observed, that the above payments are not a specification of
the amounts actually received for the period in question, because the
Commissioners may have had other expenses for which they afterwards
drew on the banker, but these sums may serve as a tolerably correct indication
of their expenses, and were probably intended as such by Mr
Lee. At this time no fixed salary was allowed, but Congress resolved
that all expenses should be paid, and that such an additional compensation
should be granted, as might afterwards be deemed expedient by
Congress.
</p><p>
On the 1st of June, 1778, Mr Lee wrote to Congress; "I am of opinion,
with our colleague, Mr Adams, that it would be better for the
public, that the appointment of your public Ministers were fixed, instead
of being left at large, and their expenses indefinite. From experience,
I find the expense of living in that character cannot well be less
than three thousand pounds sterling a year, ($13,333) which I believe is
as little as is allowed to any public Minister beyond the rank of consul."
<cite>Arthur Lee's Correspondence</cite>, Vol. II. p. 165.
</p><p>
The original mode of paying Ministers abroad continued, however,
till October 4th, 1779, when Congress,
</p><p>
<em>Resolved</em>, That each of the Ministers Plenipotentiary, be allowed at
the rate of two thousand five hundred pounds sterling ($11,111) per annum;
and each of their Secretaries at the rate of one thousand pounds
sterling ($4,444) per annum, in full for their services and expenses respectively.
</p><p>
"That the salary of each of the said officers be computed from the
time of leaving his place of abode to enter on the duties of his office,
and be continued three months after notice of his recall." <cite>Secret
Journals</cite>, Vol. II. p. 272.
</p><p>
The salaries continued fixed at the above sums during the remainder
of the revolution, and till May 7th, 1784, when the salary of Ministers
was reduced to $9000, and that of Secretaries to $3000 per annum.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_37_37" id="Footnote_37_37"></a><a href="#FNanchor_37_37"><span class="label">[37]</span></a> Dr Franklin expresses this opinion very strongly on several occasions;
and after he was appointed Minister Plenipotentiary, with the
duties of commercial agent attached to his office, he repeatedly solicited
Congress to separate these duties, and to leave him in charge only of
those branches of business, which pertained to him in the character of
Minister. See <cite>Franklin's Correspondence</cite>, Vol. III. pp. 90, 108, 119, 131.</p></div>
